"Is adult life after college just sort of, guesswork and taking it one day at a time?",344,bowpxj,"I graduated college at 22, I'm 25 now, and not in my field, but working towards it. A lot of my day-to-day life is figuring things out and wondering where I'm heading and going. Most of the time, I do not know what I am doing, I am just guessing, what to eat for dinner, where to go on my day off, what jobs to apply for, everything in life is sort of guessing for me. I don't mind it, but there's no one to essentially hold your hand, and I'm wondering if other people felt the same about all this. Guessing where to go, guessing what job to take. 

&#x200B;

In high school and college, everything is given to you. Your schedule, your friends, essentially, your life. With being a free man, you have so much time at your disposal and it's kind of bizarre not to try to make anything of it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; is life after college just a guessing game, and what do you do?",2019-05-15 14:24:22
“Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” Bill Gates said it. Can you commit to being supportive to this community?,287,9bkhce,"When I hear people on this sub telling others:

* Get used to the grind
* You're not supposed to like your job
* Just appreciate the situation that you're in, some people don't even have a job!
* Hey, that's just how it is - when you're 35/40/45, you get used to it

It hurts me so much that people are spreading this message. It's not the truth. If you aren't happy with your job, don't make that sadness/resignation someone else's reality. 

If you didn't know the story of the 50 year old architect... 

>A woman had lived her life wanting to be an architect but never having the means to do it. At 40, she finally did. Those around her told her ""It's going to take you 10 years to become an architect with the amount of time you can afford to commit to school."" She knew it would take her a long time, but she also knew that (God willing) the ten years was going to pass anyway, and at the end of those ten years, she would be an architect or not.

In ten years you are going to be \*fill-in-the-blank\* or not, so what's your plan? 

Some of us have those 10 years. Whether it's you or I that doesn't, let's prop people up and support their dreams. If you see this, can you commit to that support?

We all need it.

Update: got a job offer but failed drug test due to marijuana in NorCal . Is this end of the road?,264,9nj22q,"So some suggested I just go and tell the truth. I told them that I had make a mistake and smoked and that I didn’t have any disability to get the doctor recommendation for prescription. I had a doctors Rec couple of years before but not currently and that I didn’t need to be high all the time to function and work. They said since it is a national company they were ok if I were able to get the rec. I do have some medical issues but I didn’t get any rec for it because I had quit smoking. They said as long as the recommendations was given for ADA defined issues then it would be ok. So I went ahead and got a doctors recommendation today for some health issues. Therefore I would be able to get this job now. Was stressed out as I’ve been unemployed for a while but looks like light at the end of the road

What do people do to make over 200k a year?,227,b1wixu,"So i’m in school now (in Finland) and my grades are pretty good and i have motivation. My problem is that i don’t know what job i’d want to pursue in the future.

 I just looked at some sub where everyone is complaining about having to have a ton of experience just to make 30k a year. That is the opposite of where i want to end up and i got me thinking. I have always been told just to go to school and get good grades but I’ve seen that it doesn’t always get you rich or happy. Law school and medical school would be ways there i guess, but they don’t interest me too much.

What are some jobs where you can make 200k+a year? 

I don’t need a motivational speech about “do what you love” because my dreams and interests can’t be achieved with 30k a year. I would like to know what people do to end up in those numbers (the 200k+). Sorry if the post is kind of a train wreck tho, I’m not used making posts like these.",2019-03-16 22:53:06
"I was sexually assaulted at work and I want to leave the firm, but I have only been working there for 6 months. How do I handle the “why are you leaving?” question while interviewing?",216,bxpmnx,"Basically what the title says. I am a 24yo woman in finance. This is/was my dream job. I love my team.

Unfortunately, I was sexually assaulted by a partner at my firm a few weeks ago. I anonymously reported the incident and there was some investigation, but nothing came of it. I don’t feel comfortable coming forward publicly — though this isn’t the point of this post.

My new senior-level marketing position seems to include washing dishes. I can't quit. How do I politely say no?,212,bo7p48,"Two days ago, I started a new job. It's a very small company where there are about 8 of us in total. I'm the only female and the youngest by about 15 years. 

It's an executive level, marketing role but they did ask if I could also fulfil the admin role, as they recently dismissed the receptionist. Fair enough. 

Here's where the issue comes in. They have been (strongly) hinting that I need to wash the dishes and clean the office daily. This was not communicated in any of the interviews. On top of this, I do not use any mugs, plates, etc. in the office. They want me to clean up after everyone else, every day, on top of my marketing and business development responsibilities. My hours are also an hour longer than anyone else's in order accommodate the cleaning. 

I don't mean to bitch and whine, but I worked very hard to get where I am now.

Is this fair? How can I politely say no? Or do I just silently suck it up? 

TL;DR: Started a new job as marketing and business development manager. They also want me to wash everyone's dishes and coffee mugs every day. How do I put my foot down and say no, without losing my job? Or do I just shut up and di it?

EDIT: For those of you wondering, I'm not even young. I'm 30. It just so happens that the other people in the company are older men in there mid 40's to 50's.",2019-05-13 22:06:29

What if I don't like the person I'm becoming because of my career?,200,bi5h8t,"I've found career success, but I feel deeply conflicted about the career situation I am in and some days I don't like the person I am becoming. I make more money than I ever thought I'd make, but I work 6 or 7 days a week and feel constantly at the mercy of my email. I get messages most evenings and weekends and am expected to always be available. As I move up and get into more complex managerial positions, I find myself having to make awful decisions--like potentially letting someone go who has earnestly done the work he was asked to do, but failed at office politics. This really eats at me. I don't want to be a corporate drone--I'm more independent minded than that. I feel like I can't speak freely. I feel caged.

After being poor & unemployed I just got two job offers in the last 48 hours & I am stressed. Help?,192,bkc8j8,"Hi. 
A few months ago I interviewed for a job that I wasn’t really qualified for & i didn’t hear back. I kind of wrote it off & I asked my brother to pull some strings at his company to get me a job, which he did. I haven’t started yet but I signed the offer. I was just excited to have money to pay bills again so i jumped at it. The night after I signed the offer the larger company contacts me & says that they want to move forward & they emailed me 25 minutes ago asking to set up a time tomorrow to talk about the offer. 
.
.
Now, I am freaking because 1) I’ve never made this much money before at either job & it’s kind of surreal. Going from 0$ to $35,000 /yr is a big deal.  2) I already signed one offer (though I don’t start till the end of the month)
.
.
The job I applied for months ago is at a much larger company, lots of room for growth & I could probably make a sustainable career there. The one I accepted is a bit more of a hack job, but it’s in a field that I’d like to get in & there’s a lot of travel required which I really like. What do I do? 
.
Job 1: no freedom, a little bit more $$, lots of room for growth, stuck inside a big building all day creating events for rich people.
Job 2: working with data, less $$, not a ton of room within the company, a lot of freedom to choose my own schedule & travel.

Is it OK to Stop Working Hard?,189,ak2t33,"Context: Worked for large company for a few years. Annual reviews one person in department gets big raise, and extra 2.5-5% on top of annual. 

Last year I busted my ass, working 80 hour weeks, 7 days, coming back at night to cover emergencies.

Other departments come to me when they need something done. I am a doer and was just doing my best to support the product at launch. 

Review time, no big bonus. I didn't talk to boss because it is already done and won't be changed, and I won't be satisfied with the answer. 

Instead I went full office space and began doing my basic requirements. 8 hours, 5 days. Other departments come for help, and I tell them to ask (Specific responsible person). 

I feel bad because I can do more, but I don't see the purpose of doing more. I can do the minimum and make the same salary, and be home with the family more.

"This is one for the employers. I found out I have lowest salary in the whole company, and now I feel like an idiot. What should I do?",181,bmjtht,"I will try to keep it short. I got hired over a year ago in a Hotels & Resorts company, for the IT position. The list of my duties and projects grew and still grows rapidly and I manage to keep up even though I work alone.

The employer seems really happy and surprised, since he wasn't even sure I could do the job. I had a degree in Information Technology and zero experience, at the time. We work very close and he is my only supervisor. He keeps throwing problems and stuff that need solving and fixing at me, and I have never said ""I can't do it, I don't know how.""

I am a pretty fast learner, you see, and given some time I can have at least basic knowledge on anything that comes my way. A Jack of all trades, I guess, but mostly technology trades.

 In the winter months we started using Filemaker (data base platform), and I developed 2 solutions. One of which manages the payroll of all the employees. As you can imagine I, now, know everything.

I work hard, harder than I've ever worked. My worst fear is disappointing him and that says it all.

It also happens I have the lowest salary of all. Even the waiters at the buffet restaurant. I was a waitress, I don't wish to insult any one, but they don't work from home on holidays. Or answer the phone any time it rings even on my day off.

I believe I deserve a raise for all I do. And I will ask for a big one , too. But I don't want him to think that knowing the salary of others had anything to do with it. I feel it would brake his trust.

How should I do it?",2019-05-09 16:27:57
Has anybody had career setbacks due to mental illness?,179,begt1w,"I'm currently working two jobs, a custom framer at a craft store and as a childcare worker. I have a BA in psychology, and I did well in college despite having a mental illness. I got an internship as a case worker for the county and have worked as a behavior therapist. As the years went by my mental illness got worse and I wasn't able to function. Symptoms of mania got worse. Depression got worse to the point where I was hospitalized twice. It was very difficult. When I worked psychology-related fields I found out that the field was too overwhelming for me. I just couldn't handle it. It's been 5 years since I graduated, and I've been stable. I go to therapy and take my medication. I use coping skills. I've been able to hold a retail job for 2 years and have had my childcare job for 3 months. I have an internship in an office as a development associate. I feel very lost because I struggle with money alot, and this stresses me out alot.

Most of his stunt jobs are either very easy (some actors need a stunt double even just to run), or very safe (things that look dangerous in the movies are actually very controlled). He says he  shouldn't get paid the amount he does for the work. He makes well over 6 figures, when you include the steady royalties checks he gets monthly.

What should I do about this?,169,b6zbgy,"It's a tad complicated but long story short, I use an iPad that I share with my boss at my job for doing my daily duties. I unlocked it and on the screen was an email between my boss, his manager and the HR rep about how my time there is limited and originally they were going to let me go last week but the new hire was on vacation. The language in the email was pretty insulting tbh as I have a medical condition that involves a compromised immune system, so I get sick about once per month for a day or two, and they were calling me a 'pussy' and a 'punk' for calling in sick so frequently. Nobody knows about my condition because my boss has repeatedly said, ""if you're sick, just call in sick, I don't need a reason or an excuse."" Is this grounds to terminate me? Personally I hate this job so it might be a blessing in disguise but it's hard to find a decent paying job out here with my job experience (or lack thereof). I've been spending a lot of my time looking for a new job already but nothing so far. I live in Vancouver, BC of that helps anything. I've also been made aware that starting this month, each employee is entitled to 5 sick days per year. I have two documented. Is it a really bad idea to take a few sick days to get my max because they're firing me anyway? (Obviously I wouldn't say it that way to management...) Any advice on this would be appreciated.

Edit: I was diagnosed last week with an immunosuppressive disorder so I didn't know about it going into the job. 

Edit 2: Well as of an hour ago I'm jobless. I get two weeks of severance pay and 1 month until my benefits run out.

How do some people change careers so easily?,167,bxiz4q,"For example, I was reading an article recently and it mentioned this woman.

During her career, she worked as a chief publicist in multiple countries, owned an online activeware company, was a therapeutic riding instructor, and developed waterproof shoe covers. And she’s only in like her 40’s! And only has 1 undergrad degree in psychology!

How the heck does one person accomplish so much? Is it money, connections, good timing, work ethic, having versatile skills, luck? A combination of factors?

Then you have someone else for example, who has like a Masters degree or something, and it stuck working retail for years and is dying to get out.

Or maybe you have someone who is an accountant, and wants to become an engineer. They would have to spend years and thousands of dollars to change careers, whereas some people switch fields like it’s nothing?

How come some people are able to do so much, while others just flounder?

Teaching is an extremely difficult job that doesn’t pay well financially or emotionally. Should I leave education and follow my dream of becoming the first lawyer in my family? Or should I fight the good fight and stay in education?,162,bw412f,"After battling constant foul language, poor behavior, obscene amounts of cell phone usage during instructional time, and lack of parental support, I’m done...or at least I think I am. I expected to encounter behavioral issues as an educator in a Title 1 high school, what I didn’t expect was the blatant usage of unethical practices to increase or stabilize the graduation rate.

I made the decision to not sign my contract for the upcoming school year and I am now facing a career crisis. Should I take the LSAT this fall and give Law a try or should I continue my attempt at being the change I want to see in education?

Just a little background: I recently finished my 4th year of teaching, 8th year in education. In my 4 years as an educator, 2 of those years were spent at the elementary level and 2 at the high school level.

Is it reasonable to make a career decision based on the desire for free time and low stress?,163,bamaqr,"I'll be brief. I'm a 24 year old medical student and soon, I have to pick what kind of doctor I want to be.

**My main worry** is that I am picking a specialty based on quality of life and its easiness and not considering long-term things like prestige and job satisfaction. I have always chosen the difficult path in my life and I am not comfortable with choosing something less than grueling. I also feel me choosing an easy life is an **immature** decision.

I am split between picking a well respected route of medicine vs. one not so well respected. Both pay the same.

**Option 1:** More stress, harder work, more prestige and acknowledgement as a ""doctor.""

**Option 2:** Less stress, easier work, but a lot of people don't even view this as ""real doctoring"" despite the MD. This view has been sort of ingrained in me as well, which is why the conflict arises.

Both have approximately the same job prospects, versatility, and salary. I am leaning towards Option 2 because of the low-stress and possibility for free time to pursue my hobbies.

"28F , recovering addict , 3 time felon...What can I realistically do with my life?",155,be93ux,"Hey guys , 

&#x200B;

Informative title , I know. I'm a pretty transparent type of person and don't mind being open and honest about the experiences I've had in my life so far. I apologize if this is long but truly appreciate anyone that takes the time to read. 

I'm a female , 28 years old , born and raised in the US , and have a long history of drug abuse. I've been sober for 4 1/2 years which will probably always be the best decision I've ever made in my life. I started using at age 10 , dropped out of high school at the end of my junior year and continued my destructive path until I was 24 when I got sober. In between all of that , I caught endless amount of drug charges , went through rehab and jail countless times , lost my father suddenly 2 weeks before my 23rd birthday and dealt with ( still do) a very broken family. Needless to say , a career was the last thing I was ever thinking about through these times. I managed to gain 3 felonies on my record ( all a direct result of my addiction ). Possession charges and a receiving stolen property charge ( I used my ID to sell something that was obviously stolen) During my years of active addiction I had pretty common jobs ; waiting tables  , selling glasses at a kiosk in the mall , telemarketing. Hated them all. When I got sober , a friend of mine was a crew leader for a construction maintenance cleaning company and got me a job. The hours were long , exhausting and my boss was a very opinionated woman who I somehow really got a long with but didn't always agree with the way she handled some business. After about 90 days at that job , I got promoted to Crew supervisor and had my own crew of about 6-8 people to run everyday. I didn't necessarily love the supervisor part of it all , but I did like delegating tasks. I also love manual labor. After about 2 years I left that job for a behavioral health tech position working in a drug and alcohol treatment facility.   I really thought at that time that this was what I wanted to do. I wanted to eventually get my GED and go back to school to become an addiction counselor. What ended up happening was me being taken advantage of at that company and made to run psycho educational groups every single day with no schooling behind me and only having a little over 2 years sober. I got burnt out , and I got burnt out quick. I became extremely checked out and ended up making a very impulsive decision ( which I don't regret but have absolutely learned to never do again) and quit my job without anything else lined up. The stress of the job fell off my shoulders but then the stress of life and careers jumped right on. I was jobless for the first 3 months of 2018 and finally found a job through a friend in the 12 step program I was in doing Underwriting for a Loan company. I had no idea what any of it entailed and was extremely nervous because not only do I hate numbers of any kind , but i'm horrible at math. Anyway , I'm still currently with this company and although there's no part of it that I really do enjoy ,and sitting at a desk all day is driving me nuts ,  I would never abruptly leave like I did the last one. It's a very flexible job , my commute is 10 minutes and my boss is extremely understanding when I need time off. Nonetheless , it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I recently , about 2 months ago , obtained my GED and now am trying to navigate what I want to do with my life. 

&#x200B;

I feel lost in the sense of never really having that chance to figure it out when I was a teenager because I was getting high. I have felonies now , although they are all about 8 years old at this point. I don't want to waste my time going to college for a degree and I ultimately won't be able to get a job doing because of my past. I also hear horror stories of people going into extreme debt for a degree that they can't even get a job for. I'm not willing to do that. I've been trying to do some research about trade schools but I also don't know if my body can handle doing that for the rest of my life. I had surgery on my ankles when I was a baby & have always had issues with being on my feet for long periods of time. I love cleaning and organizing and attempted starting up my own business but it fizzled out for the most part and i'm just not sure I want to own a business. 

&#x200B;

This is a lot and all over the place but it's a pretty good idea of how my brain functions on a daily basis. I'm not getting any younger and I can't help but feel like i'm running out of time.

"Old employer is stuffing Glassdoor, making fake LinkedIn profiles, but is becoming an influencer. Can I do anything?",148,bepgyh,"Very long story short, I worked for this company for 6 months about 4 years ago. They're a dumpster fire, so I left as soon as I found another opportunity in the same city. While I never felt unsafe, it's a genuinely horrible place to work, so I did my best to let people know that – left a truthful one-star review on Glassdoor and steered anyone who asked clear of them.

&#x200B;

They unsuccessfully tried to have my GD review removed (and a coworker got a legal notice of defamation about her review, lol) so I occasionally check up on their page to make sure it's still up. The profile is just brimming with fake, vague, five-star reviews. You know the type. I report them all and reached out to Glassdoor's customer service team to let them know, but I doubt they care.

&#x200B;

This week, I got a LinkedIn connection request and vague intro direct message from someone purporting to work at this company with a very obviously fake profile picture. Reverse image search confirmed it was a stock photo. I called them out in response to the message (just pasted the tineye link) and they immediately changed the picture but didn't respond. I then image-searched their new photo and found it again (they had reversed the stolen image this time). I reported the profile to LinkedIn as fake and hopefully it gets taken down.

&#x200B;

But as the title says, the company and specifically its CEO has a growing thought-leadership presence in legit publications. He's a contributor to Inc and Forbes, which all link back to the company website, and the company has been featured in a local tech pub.

&#x200B;

I know I probably should just let it go, but this place is awful (crazy turnover, missed paychecks, abuse management) and I don't want other young professionals to get hoodwinked and have a bad experience. I'm well beyond the point of ever needing these connections again, so I'm not worried about ""burning a bridge."" I have some pull with the local publication that featured them, but I don't want to make myself look bad by blowing something up that doesn't really affect me.

&#x200B;

As far as I know, they're not breaking the law (just the LI & GD terms of service), but this is super shady spammer-like behavior and I want them to get called out for it, or at least stop doing it. Is reaching out to the local press that featured them or the national publications that feature him a terrible idea? Is a public Twitter thread with screenshots tagging the company just blowing this up unnecessarily and will reflect poorly on me? Anything else could I do?",2019-04-18 22:12:05
So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?,153,8hnlfs,"## So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?

Several years ago, I was having a meeting with a hiring manager at a firm in the city. It was going great...we had really connected, we were telling jokes, etc. It was just a real good conversation. The meeting was winding down and he had asked ""Anything else to add?"" Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a statue of Peter Griffin.Me\- ""I noticed you have a Peter Griffin statue.""Him\- ""Who?""Internal Monologue\- ""Hmmmm....ok, so obviously not a *Family Guy* fan. I should probably just move on.""Me\- ""The statue over there.""Him\- ""Oh, someone bought that for me.""Internal Monologue\- ""I should probably just move on.""Me\- ""Oh I get it! It's because you look like him.""Internal Monologue\- ""Why are you still talking?"" Having a coherent, meaningful conversation is hard enough. But with the pressure of a career involved, successfully interviewing can be darn near impossible. I know what you are thinking\- ""Interviewing is easy...I'm great with people."" Confidence is great, but it will only get you so far. As well as the interview is going, you can just as easily talk yourself right out of the job. Sure, the person interviewing you may be smiling, but you never know if they're just being polite. Official feedback may be\- ""We really liked you and your thought process, but..."" but internal feedback may be\-""I am stupider for having heard that."" Interviews, for the most part, are structured and simple enough to prepare for. Anyone can answer specific and factual questions about their experiences and career. It's easy when there is a format and the candidate is led down a path of responses. But there are two key areas that are difficult for candidates. When you get to these ""open\-ended"" portions of the interview, that's where panic can set in. As a recruiter, the two questions I get most \(other* than How do you sleep at *night? and What is it like to not* have* a soul?\) are

1. How do I answer when I am asked ""Tell me a little about yourself?""
2. What do I say when I am asked ""Do you have any questions?""

Simple right? In theory, these are very easy questions. But the more you think about it, the easier it is to become confused and disoriented, resulting in a panicked mess of silence. Or worse. You could compare the person you are talking to with an overweight buffoon.

## Tell Me A Little About Yourself

Keep in mind, the interviewer isn't asking for your life's story. The key words are ""a little."" But which part should you share? That time in 4th grade that you totally rocked it at Field Day in the tricycle race? I know I know, it shows determination and coolness under pressure. GRIT. Technically this would be better suited for a LinkedIn video recreation. So what IS the interviewer looking for in this answer? They are really just looking to get to know you, your personality, and what details you find relevant to your own life. They want to know your conversation style. Don't overthink it. The more you can relate it to your career, the better. Keep in mind, they really don't want to know ""you"" during this initial meeting. They just want to know ""work you."" The polite, sterile, first impression you. You can dictate the first impression you make. Practice it...don't just wing it. Remember\- there are technically no ""wrong"" ways to answer this question. Keep it short, keep it sweet, and keep it RELEVANT. Some examples\-GOOD \- I've lived in this area my whole life. On a personal note I enjoy reading, fishing and traveling with my family. On a professional note, I've been in recruiting for more than 15 years now and it's a passion of mine. I love staying current on the latest techniques by following X, Y, and Z online.BAD\- I do a great impression of a hot dogGOOD\- I spend a lot of time in my craft studio. I fancy myself quite the amateur woodcarver. Sometimes its good to get away, enjoy the quiet, and just focus on the best way to create something. I find that it keeps me refreshed for all of life's challenges and keeps the creative juices flowing.BAD\- \*knocks over water and runs away\* Also, confidence is great. But you don't want to come off as arrogant. For example\-Interviewer\- I just love a good cup of Starbucks. You like Starbucks Adam? I love a nice venti soy blonde latte. What's your drink of choice?Me\- I like a large coffee.Interviewer\- You mean venti.Me\- No, *Venti* is 20. Large is large. Infact, Tall is large, Gra*nde i*s Spanish for large. Venti is Italian. It's the only one that doesn't mea*n l*arge. Congratulations, you're stupid in 3 languages. Just keep it simple, basic, and most importantly, safe. Who you are, what you are all about, and why your career is what it is. Don't just rehash your experience and your career....talk about how you the person have evolved in the career and what you get out of it.

## Do You Have Any Questions?

The answer is never ""no."" Never. You want to show interest. You want to show that you are thinking long term about the role, the company, your career. A ""no"" shows a limited view of the role. There is zero chance you completely understand everything discussed about the role, the company, etc. When you say ""no"" it usually means\-

1. I just want this to be over because a\) I need to get back to work b\) I need to make the train c\) My meter has been up for 25 minutes and my car may be getting towed right now.
2. I can't hold this bodily function in any longer.
3. I am not a forward thinking person. I didn't hear anything during the interview worth following up on. I am a person of limited imagination and thinking exhausts me.
4. I could care less about this particular job. I just want a job. This job would do. Kindly stop talking and offer me this job. I need money.

### Questions You Should Ask

1. Why is this position open?/What happened to the last person in the role?
2. How does this position contribute to the long term success of the company?
3. What is the average length of time someone spends in this role?
4. What is the growth plan/career track for this role?
5. Typically, what are the biggest challenges one encounters when starting this role?
6. Based on our conversation today, what parts of my experience do you envision being the biggest assets in this role?
7. Based on our conversation today about my experience, do you anticipate any difficulties of my getting up to speed in this role?
8. What is your estimated timeline for hiring for this role?
9. If I think of any other relevant questions, would you be offended if I reach out? Do you prefer email or call?

By asking these questions, the candidate is able to:

* Exhibit an understanding of what the role entails.
* Understand and demonstrate their experience fits in \(and doesn't\).
* Show they understand the macro impact of this role on the company.
* Show they understand the micro focus of the role as a self\-contained job
* Have a general idea of when the role will be filled.
* Obtain a reason/permission to follow up with the hiring manager.

Having all of that info from the hiring manager at the end of the interview allows the candidate to have the best Thank You letter ever. The candidate can reinforce ""why"" they are a fit for the role. The candidate can address the potential shortcomings the employer has identified. And the best part is, they have some time to think about it to put the best message out there and leave the best impression with the hiring manager. Without asking those questions...when you tell the interviewer ""Nah, I'm good. No questions,"" your follow up letters look like ""Hey, remember that time when I interviewed? That was awesome.""Odds are 1\) It wasn't awesome and 2\) They don't remember.",2018-05-07 16:45:57
New hire is making more than me. How should I address this with my boss professionally?,146,bwvq34,"I just found out that the new hire is making $2.00 more per hour than I am. I'm trying to understand why she was offered more than me given she has little to no experience in the industry. I was given the task of training her and I have gone above and beyond to ensure she has the knowledge to succeed in her role. Last week we were discussing vacation time and I was explaining to her that 40 hours of it is accrued, but she insisted that her offer states differently. She pulled up her offer letter on her phone and shows me where it talks about vacation time and right about it is her salary. I couldn't not look, it was right there! Of course, I didn't say anything, but I was screaming on the inside!! 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How can someone I'm training for the same role be making more than I am? I came to this company 7 months ago with over 2 years of experience in the industry, extensive knowledge of the market, and a college degree. I was recognized with multiple awards at my old company and had a proven track record of succeeding in my role. Now she's here with no experience and no college degree and making more than me. (Side note: according to my manager, her resume had a few years of experience in our industry. But clearly that isn't true because I have had to explain very basic concepts to her. Someone with any kind of experience would already be very familiar with essential, basic concepts.)

&#x200B;

I talked to my manager and asked her for a raise. Her response was to set up a meeting with the regional manager and discuss it with her. She also told me that its probably not in the budget and usually you don't qualify for a raise until you've been employed with the company 1 year.

I’ve never envisioned myself in a particular job, so I’m feeling a little lost.

I’ve never pictured myself climbing the corporate ladder or understood the undying dedication some people have for their careers and companies that can drop you in a heartbeat. I just work for a paycheck, I have no passion for my work at all and find more satisfaction in my hobbies and side projects, which involve art and photography.

I don't know if they realized that it was more than they are paying me as all the hr is new there.

I have been in my company for 5 years and have really gone above and beyond this past year to make big things happen for them.

My company has taken a huge change in direction recently (shortcuts), and we are loosing people right and left because of the highly stressful environment this creates.

"Mid/late 30s Career change, any interest in this story?",147,8n31hw,"I see a lot of posts on this forum looking for help on how to go about changing career after the reality of an industry hits home, or after spending a long time in an area and feeling trapped, or just a general lack of passion.

I have felt this pain, and I wonder if I can help a bit.

It has been a proud couple of months for me - I both turned 40, and started a fantastic new job that I had been targeting for a very long time, after finding myself unhappy and depressed in a dead end job in a separate industry at 35. I was able to do this without taking a pay cut.

It has been a long, and at times painful journey fraught with difficulty, but is it one that might offer some value to someone out there.

Would anyone be interested in reading such a story?

Edit: Ok I will write it up. Will need to be tomorrow morning though. I would like to do a good job of writing it, and I need some sleep.

**OK here we go:**

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that my experience will not be applicable to everyone. We all have a different situation, and some of the things I describe will not be possible to replicate. That said, it is my hope someone will get something out of it, even if it is just motivation rather than a strategy or practical advice. 

Secondly, I also need to recognise that luck played a part. I would like to believe that some of the luck was created through hard work, but at certain points people did things for me that they really didn’t have to.
I will try and keep it brief, but my story takes place over a long time with lots of twists and turns, so you might want to grab a coffee! Anyway, here goes.


Five years ago, I had painted myself into a career corner. 12 years working in a technical role for large Telecommunication companies left me with a very specific set of skills in a profession I had no passion for. (I don’t want to divulge too much detail about the role, as I don’t want to offend anyone who does it). I had grown very competent at it, but it wasn’t for me. Added to this, the only way “up” was through general management, which held little appeal for me, and in an area where people traditionally retired after doing the same role for 40 years or more, there was also very little opportunity for development or movement.


Anyway, one day I had an epiphany (won’t go into detail), and decided I absolutely must change something, anything.


Trouble is, and I think there are a lot of people in this boat – *I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.*


My first step was to look around for other jobs at the company I worked for, as I figured it was probably practical to make an internal transfer in a company that trusted me, than go in “cold” elsewhere. I had a good relationship with my Line Manager, who was very understanding and supportive. He didn’t want me to leave, but he understood that I was unhappy and that in the long term it would be no good for him or for the team to try and make me stay. I suppose you could say that my first stroke of luck was having a good relationship with an intelligent and supportive Manager. 


We devised a plan. Under the guise of “professional development” in learning about the company, he arranged for me to spend a day with other teams, based on job descriptions I saw on the company Intranet. All had partial skills matches with what I did already, and on paper a role within any of the teams would represent meaningful career progression. I did this about three times, and I certainly learned a lot – about what I didn’t want to do. Here was a lesson learned for me, no matter how amazing a job description sounds, the reality can be much different.


I kept going. Then, a stroke of luck: while this was happening, my team were “treated” to a training course. It was the first piece of official training most of the team had had for nearly a decade, so we were looking forward to it. I was on a specific piece of software we were migrating to, and it was very hard to use. It was so specific in fact, that the trainers had to be flown in from Europe at great expense. 


They “phoned it in” as they say in the US. The trainers were poor, and one of them was offensive and rude, particularly to older members of the team who were having trouble picking up the software. I ended up assisting, as I had used the software extensively before and had an affinity for technology. I managed to defuse the situation, (aforementioned trainer was going to get punched).


Afterwards, I fed back to my manager what I thought of the training (awful). He challenged me to do better. I had some good feedback from the team, and was already mentoring new starters, so I thought – why not? I was convinced I could not do any worse. 


Our contract with the training provider was not renewed, and there was a training gap, so I volunteered to deliver a course. I had no idea really what I was doing, I only resolved to do two things: Ensure everyone learned everything they needed to, and treat everyone in the room with dignity.  


It went brilliantly, and I loved it. It caught me by surprise, I am normally a very quiet and reserved person, so public speaking in front of colleagues should have terrified me, but it didn’t. My parents had warned me off education as a career prospect early on, as they were both teachers and said there was no money in it. In the Public Sector, this was (is?) certainly true. I was determined to do make this work however, and decided to do some research. 

*What if there was some way I could combine something I was good at (technology), with some I actually cared about (education), and not take a pay cut in the process?*


*Technical Training* was what I found, and that is what I do now.


Of course, I was only half way there, I had found a potential career, but I wasn’t actually doing it yet. I applied for some Training Roles, but got no responses. It became evident that I needed the experience. It was at this point I had another knockback, and a blow to my confidence. My Manager set me with a meeting with our HoD. My mission was to convince him that our department needed a full-time trainer, and that I was that person. I was naïve however, and didn’t realise that what I needed was a bulletproof business justification – this was after all, a penny counting operational department. For all intents and purposes, I was laughed out of the room. Awful moment for me.


I didn’t give up. My company was big enough that we had our own training department, and I kept my eyes open for job opportunities there. I wanted nothing left to chance - when an opportunity came up I wanted to be 1st in line. To that end, I volunteered for every training delivery opportunity possible. I dressed professionally so trainees felt they were getting a “paid for” experience (they weren’t). I did my very best to ensure the training was fun and engaging, everyone left the training room armed with what they needed to know, and I made sure they felt 10 feet tall. I created an online community using our corporate intranet, recording and uploaded lots of tutorial videos to it which people found useful. At this point some of my colleagues thought I was a suck-up, but I didn’t care, I was too far invested and had a plan.


I played the long game. It took maybe 6-9 months of this, but my reputation grew. Managers from over the country started asking for me specifically to deliver training, and they negotiated with my Line Manager to free me up from my day job so I could.


Eventually, I got the attention of the training department, and I interviewed for the next available position as a Technical Trainer. They were very impressed with the work I had done on my own, and sought feedback from the people I trained – which (I assume) must have been positive. My strategy had worked, I was the person they wanted!


After the interview process, I was offered the role - at 15% less than my current salary. To train people to do the role that I was currently in. I went from elation to disappointment in a heartbeat. Another awful moment. My Wife and I were saving every penny for a house deposit, and there was no way we could take that kind of income hit. 


Despite all the hard work getting me to this point, I had to tell them no, I could not accept a base salary cut. I needed them to counter. It was a gamble, and one of the most difficult conversations I have ever had.  


It was a calculated gamble though. I was miles ahead of the other candidates, and I deliberately left salary negotiation as late as possible in the process in case they low balled me. I figured, the longer they went without completing the hire, the stronger my negotiating position became. Especially if they made the foolish move of informing the unsuccessful candidates before I formally accepted.


Unbeknown to me, this also paid off. The hiring Manager became desperate, and drove for half a day to the HR Directors Office to convince her that he needed me for the job. He was successful, and had a whole new job band created just for me, so they could pay my current salary.


**Success!!!** Everything up until this point took about 2.5 years.


For the next 2.5 years, I set about learning my new field. My story is already pretty long, but I need to mention that this part was also quite difficult. I enjoyed the work for sure, and was good at it – but going from the guy who knows everything, to the guy who knows nothing was tough. Learning from people 10 years my junior, reporting to people 5 years my junior. It was humbling, even a bit depressing at times.


I did a lot of graft however, learned everything I could, as fast as I could. I had fantastic professional development opportunities too. As a result, I outgrew the role. Now armed with a whole lot of relevant experience in my CV, I recently started a new job, in a new company, in a more senior role and I finally feel like the change has been a success. 


If you have made it this far, you can imagine it was a long road. There is actually a lot I have left out, but this post is already too long, so I’ll just say thank you for reading and if you have any questions I am more than happy to answer.


**TLDR:**

-	Use any research method you can think of to find something that you both have an affinity for, and care about.

-	Find a practical way to go about making a change.

-	Don’t give up when you experience setbacks.

I made a script that tailors my resume to a job position. Am I cheating?,148,9wtwn1,"Hi! I'm rather designer, not a developer but I wrote a script (javascript + PHP) that modifies my resume to any designer/developer position by searching key terms or key phrases in a job description.  I made my resume in JSON structure for fast modification (inserting or deleting skills). I also use parsed job descriptions from Indeed/Jooble to teach my super-easy ML-algorithm (it helps me to search more key phrases and skills from different sources)

"Quit My Full-Time Job For Mental Health. Happy Now, But Not Proud of New Job. Does Anyone Else Feel This Way?",146,9w9ym6,"I quit my full-time (dream) job a couple of weeks ago after only 8+ months there. While it was within the publishing field that I had always dreamed of working in, it also came with a lot of stress and it took its toll on my already flaring anxiety and depression. Not to mention the pay was low with very little potential for advancement. 

Cut to the present, I am now working a simple full-time job (not complex in any way) in a vastly different industry with even less pay and no benefits, but...I am so happy! I originally meant to work there part-time but the full-time just kind of landed in my lap. I barely have anything new to learn and my brain has time to relax. I can actually come home with energy! 

Does it suck not having benefits and extra perks? Yeah, but the mental and physical toil I was in forced me to go to the doctor more anyways. 

I think the only aspect that really has me hesitant...is the fact that I'm not really...PROUD of the current job I do. Its not what I pictured for myself and certainly not at this age. Its not a ""young professional"" type of career. And I don't really want to tell anyone about it.

Anyone else interested in everything?,138,blgdqg,"Hey everyone!

Ever since I can remember I've been a super curious, knowledge-seeking person which I think helped me alot in certain aspects of my life but it makes deciding which courses to take in college and what my career path will look like a nightmare...

For some background, I just turned 20 (today's my birthday!) and I'm currently in my second year of a bachelor's in Computer Science. I chose Computer Science mainly because it would allow me to get a job pretty much anywhere in the world but I don't particularly LOVE it. I'm quite interested in Psychology, Neuroscience, History,  Philosophy but also some Politics and some aspects of engineering. I'm not super extroverted but I'm also not an introvert, I like to be around people and sometimes even talk in public to a lot of people but other times I just wanna be alone for a whole weekend.

I feel like people can rely on me and I would do well on a managerial position but I'm unsure since I don't have any job experience.  I love learning about diferent cultures and how they go about their day, including traditions, ideas, how they view the world etc, so having a job that somehow included that would be amazing (although maybe hard to obtain).

Anyone that has gone through a similar situation? I have never really asked for help before because I always ended up deciding and living with the consequences but this time I want to get it right (or as close as possible anyway).

How do I deal with the fact that my colleague earns 25k more than me?,135,bdkdxb,"So I just found out my colleague earns 25k more than me. We do the same job. Actually no, we don’t do the same job. I bust my ass every day and he comes into the office and eats, watches YouTube and reads the news. Anyway, I’m not his boss so I have no control over the fact that he gets away with doing very little work. Facts:
1. I (female) have worked at the company for 2 years and 8 months. Hired as mid level and promoted to senior 7 months ago. Since starting I have received 2 raises totalling 5k.
2. He is 10 years older than me (I say that in case “experience” is an issue here). Hired as senior and has been at the company 1 year and 5 months. Since starting he has also received 2 raises totalling 5k.
3. Due to his attitude and poor performance he was put on monthly review sessions with his manager
4. I have never received any negative feedback about my performance. In fact, I regularly receive positive feedback from peers and my manager.
5. I am 100% sure of the gap and have proof.

How do I accept that I have to work the rest of my life?,140,98py11,"Hey all I didn't really know how to put the title but I'm a 25 year old and I am really struggling to wrap my mind around working my whole life still.

I've been working since I was 16 and have had quite a few different jobs since then ranging from a couple months to 3-4 years.

I recently started a job that is actually gonna set me up pretty comfortably for the future but I just cannot get used to the idea that I will be working the rest of my life. I have felt this way through all my jobs and family and friends say to suck it up this is how life gets but I just can't accept it.

I spend my whole days working and use my weekend to do nothing productive then feel bad on sundays when I have to go back to work on monday. The problem is when I dont do anything on the weekend i just usually game out and not really do anything. But even when I have weekend plans and spend the weekend away from home I don't feel relaxed. In fact I haven't found anything to occupy my times on weekends that makes me feel okay with going back to work.

I then get into this cycle of where I just can't stand it anymore and quit my job because of all the pressure.

All I can think of when im at work is coming home to game or hang out with people and then when my weekend comes all I can think about is all the million things I want to do and would rather do than go to work next week.


I have tried to use my own time to do things I am interested in but my job is quite physical and I spend most my time recovering on weekends and after work when my hobbies include exercising or being active.

90 percent of the jobs I have worked have all been physical jobs and I really don't want this to be the rest of my life. I have no real college or university experience I don't know what to do really.

I have tried talking to Councillors and work on bettering myself but after a few months I always feel the same way I do now and I really wish I could feel better about life. 

Sorry if this seems like a jumbled mess, just trying to work this off my chest.

"Does anyone have advice for a 33 year old biology major who spent her 20's traveling, focusing on relationships, and working food service, but who now wants to do more with her life?",136,blmi6o,"Hey Reddit, here's some background: I graduated at the height of the economic recession with a biology degree. I immediately went into academic research for a few years (ecology, botany, and molecular bio/cancer research), but then was laid off due to lack of funding. I decided to take my savings and go to West Africa where I ended up informally teaching science in a local grade school for a year. After that, I had the travel bug and spent the rest of my 20's basically working in food service so I could have funds to travel. I've been to 35 or so countries and did volunteer farming or other odds and ends, but nothing too involved or for too long. I mostly just enjoyed myself. I also spent a lot of time focusing on a few long-term relationships that didn't pan out. My last relationship kept me in the states for several years while I worked at a coffee shop. When it ended, I decided to try something in my field again, and after 6 months of job hunting, ended up in NYC doing environmental education. It's fun, but I am not in love with it.

I am just unsure where to go from here. I am once again job hunting (entry level positions) but to no avail. I feel like my resume screams ""person who lacks focus with an inability to take initiative"" due to my traveling 20's. I feel stuck and like now would be a good time to go back to school or start something different (like teaching yoga or travel nursing), but my interests are more philosophical than practical: science writing/communication (think Michael Pollan), making nature documentaries, ethnobotany, and even consciousness research. Is it worth it at this point to take out more loans to pursue a new career with a possible low ROI? I just really love traveling, thinking, and learning about science and am tired of working seasonal, low-paying fieldwork or food service jobs. I want to start a career of some sort....which I feel I should have done a decade ago and didn't, and am now worried I'm a little too old with too little experience to be taken seriously.",2019-05-07 07:48:16

I got a degree in Computer Science two years ago and realized the software industry culture isn't for me. How do I take the first step in changing direction?,132,bc3cnt,"After I graduated in 2017, I had a long, drawn out mental breakdown and realized in the middle of it that my career doesn't suit my temperament at all.

I absolutely cannot meet the expectation of showing up to work for 9-12 hours a day, staring at lines of code which mean nothing, only existing to make money for a company, and being locked away from the ""natural"" world. I simply don't have the interest, let alone the focus, to serve a company like that. My emotional well being can't handle it. This became especially clear after ending up in the hospital last summer in the middle of my breakdown. 

So I want to focus on what I find interesting and important, but also balance that with what keeps me centered emotionally. My personal interests are in biology and organic chemistry. I've considered finding a grad program that combines either of those with computed science, but I haven't taken any undergrad classes for what I think I want to do now.

If I did want to go to grad school, or even just get a degree in biology or chemistry, how would that even work? Would they require me to take undergrad classes first? I'd like to make my first degree mean at least something, but I also wouldn't mind abandoning it altogether if I felt I'd be happier. I should note I don't care about money really whatsoever. I'd just like enough to survive.

Thank you so much for any response! I just need anything to push me in the right direction. I need to survive but I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and miserable.",2019-04-11 21:29:18
"Considering taking a 20k pay cut for quality of life improvement. Am I insane? 27yo male, married, looking 85k to 65k.",129,9lc0ss,"I’m 27 years old, married with no kids (thinking 4-5 years out), own a home with mortgage well below what we could have afforded and have combined cash savings around 8k with 25k in combined retirement funds. We know we are behind on retirement but came out of school with a combined 100k in student loan debt and have aggressively paid it down to around 40k now (she has BS and I have BS/MBA). Overall we make considerably more right now than we need and have been using that on the student loans. 

I’ve worked in construction management since getting out of school and have had ups and downs with that. I’m very good at it and enjoy building teams and systems, but in two different roles in the industry I’ve experienced the same issues with massive hour expectations and work/life balance struggles. For context, it’s not uncommon to work long weekdays then cap the week off with over 40 hours between Friday to Sunday. My wife and I have had some issues based on her frustration with me never being home and being exhausted to the point of uselessness when I am home. I can’t blame her at all. 

I’m very strongly considering switching to manufacturing and taking a 15-20k hit in salary as a result (in a maintenance management or planning role). I initially started looking for manufacturing roles that would be around the same salary, but most either want lots of industry experience or have major travel elements. This move would however bring my hours down a lot to close to 40, and most of the roles I’m pursuing have flexibility in the hours. She works 530-4 M-Th, and while I don’t expect to work 4 10s it’s looking like I could make my M-F schedule 6-3 or something similar to get home before/when she does. 

I’m leaning heavily towards taking the step, but what negatives am I not considering? I know that this move would delay the student loan payoffs and am completely prepared for that, but what else should I be thinking about? 

Most of my family I talk to tell me to stick it out until the loans are gone, but my big fear is looking back in 4 years at a zero student loan balance and either having lost my wife or realizing I’d wasted a full decade of my youth in an industry I don’t enjoy. ",2018-10-04 16:45:16

Should you apply for a job even if you don't have *every* qualification?,125,95m7ga,"I did a lot of hiring and firing in one of my previous jobs, and one thing that we'd do on our job requisitions is list a bunch of technologies that people ""should know"". But, that didn't mean that the candidate needed to know \*every\* technology. We sorta meant it more along the lines of ""some"" to ""most"", but definitely not none.   


Here's my attempt at providing some career guidance this week: Don't let job requisitions scare you if they list stuff that you may not have any direct experience with. That said, definitely be honest with yourself. Don't apply for a position that you know that you aren't qualified for. You're wasting your time as well as the time of our interviewers. But, do not let a long list of requirements necessarily dissuade you from applying for a position that you honestly believe you could add value to.   


The worst that happens is you don't get the position. But, you also get practice tailoring your resume to the job opportunity (yes, tailoring your resume is important) and, if you're called into an interview, you also get to practice your interviewing skills - something that I've found a LOT of people need a LOT of help with.

Can you please help me convince our CEO that we need better benefits to retain good employees?,126,azapcf," 

I work for a small non-profit that has a high turnover problem. The CEO blames this problem on ""those millennials'"" lack of loyalty.  I, however, think that the problem is we live in a high(er) cost of living city in the US with an extremely low unemployment rate, and our salaries and benefits are below average, at best. Our new employees start with us all starry-eyed about the mission, but quickly realize they can make more money, better benefits, and more work/life balance somewhere else.

Our benefits are:

\-10 days vacation, 10 days sick, 2 personal days, and the usual holidays off

\-401(k) but no match

\-Medical/Dental insurance costs approx $120/mo to the employee with a $1,000 deductible

\-No disability or life insurance offered

We have very strict 9am - 6pm M-F working hours and are also expected to work evenings/weekends during some parts of the year. We are ALL salaried, so there is no overtime pay.

Now, being that we are a small non-profit, we do not have a lot of money to play with (my position is the accountant and I also handle benefits admin, so I am privy to all financial, salary, & benefits info). So, my idea is - we need to offer AWESOME ""non-monetary"" benefits.

These are some ideas I have for non-monetary benefits:

\-4 10's workweek

\-Option to work from home 1-2 days a week

\-Option to start work anytime between 7am-9am and be in the office for 8.5 to 9 hours (option to take a 30 minute lunch instead of a full hour so you can leave 30 min earlier)

\-Comp time for working evenings/weekends

\-An increase in vacation time or personal time (not sure how much is reasonable)

What do you think? Am I being too ambitious? Also, in order to convince the CEO, I think I'd need to provide evidence that other companies provide better benefits - do you know of any good sources for something like a benefits survey?

"3 months, >80 application, 3 temp agencies, 6 interviews, nothing. I can't pay my bills this month. What now?",123,bq9bgz,"Hey. Thank you for reading.

I have \~13 of customer service/retail. I was a kitchen manager at my last job.

In January, I had a serious medical episode. I collapsed at work. I should have gone to the hospital, but I was too delirious to know what was happening. I got on a bus and made it home. While this was happening, the owner of the restaurant screamed at me. I was out for a week. When I came back, the manager yelled at me in the office until I had a seizure/panic attack and was hyperventilating on the floor, then left me in the office.

After that, I couldn't be in the establishment without panic attacks. I decided to quit at the end of February. They ended up asking me to stay, and I gave them six weeks longer than was my intention. My last day was April 1st.

I promised myself that I wouldn't go back to kitchen work.

Part of the reason that I had medical issue was the physical and emotional stress of the job. I also have joint and back pain. I won't dwell on it, but I just can't do it anymore.

I decided to look for literally any entry level desk work.

I set up a linkdin and indeed account and have stalked craigslist and indeed, looked at neighborhood facebook groups. I had two friends of mine who do hiring help write my resume and the generic version of my cover letter (I customize it per application). I bought professional-looking clothes for interviews.

Three of my interviews have gone very well, and they were encouraging in their rejection letters. The other three were discouraging. One of the better interviews was Monday, and I haven't been formally rejected yet, but I think it's coming. I will follow up on Monday.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. Some of the people who interview me seem to be incredibly impressed by my skill pool (it's varied; though I have customer service, I also have an associates in graphic design, am a published author, and have a few years of entry-level coding experience). The one I just got the rejection letter from heaped praises on me, in fact. They basically told me they needed to interview one other person as a formality. I still proceeded with other applications and interviews, but I can't lie: their rejection feels like a punch to the gut.

Some of the people who interview me clearly don't know why I'm there. Two of the interviews have been with someone who chose my resume and also the person/s who would be my manager/s. In both cases, there was clearly a mismatched set of expectations about hiring qualifications between the two. One woman looked at my resume and literally wrinkled her nose and said '*Kitchen* manager?'. I tried to maintain professional behavior, but I knew it was over.

Financially, the writing is on the wall.

I can make this June's rent, but I am neglecting to pay utilities, medical bills from my episode, student loans (deffered), and health insurance. What's more, my pet has a medical issue. I was able to respond to the first emergency, but it requires follow-up that I can't pay for. I'm also low on food.

>Hi toxic_badgers,

>We are very interested in your resume. Before we continue conversations, I always like to make sure that we are on the same page as far as annual salary is concerned. When you applied, you indicated a salary expectation, yet I wanted to know if there was any flexibility there. (some other unimportant information follows.) blah blah blah, thank you.

My problem is that I honestly low-balled my self and only submitted an expectation like... 2000 dollars more than what I make now...because I didn't expect them to be interested in me... and I am willing to laterally move as far as pay because it moves me somewhere, with a title increase and there is upward mobility (unlike my current position)... But I would prefer not to have to make the same or less money. What would be the best way to approach this?

Edit: i responded with a comment from below and they told me they could not afford me.",2019-04-25 00:29:39
I got a Masters degree last year but am working retail right now - at what point will this start to hurt me?,120,b6c53k,"Hi everyone,

I graduated with a masters degree last year in a field that, ostensibly, is quite employable. However, I'm the last of my graduating class of 25 to find a job in the field. My resume is getting me interviews and I've made it to the last stage of a few different positions. I'm working two different retail jobs right now to make ends meet. I'm almost 27. 

I hate being underestimated by customers (and supervisors) who talk to me like I'm stupid, and if they treat me like that because of where and in what role I work, no doubt some hiring managers will think less of me, too. At the same time, I don't want to leave gaps on my resume, and the places I currently work at are nonprofit institutions that could pique HR's interest and help me stand out from the crowd.

At what point is my entry-level research experience going to hurt me in my job search? Three months in? Six? Nine? 

Thanks.",2019-03-28 03:32:29
How do I stay positive during the depressing stages of the job hunt?,120,9isqhr,"6 months ago I left a job with a major publisher due to an extremely unhealthy work environment. I knew the position I accepted was only ""temporary"" while I figured out what it is that I actually want to be doing. However, I've now found myself extremely depressed in this transitional position and I need out. 

I've now been applying to positions that I am very excited for, however the process is slow and we've all experienced the anxiety from never hearing back.

I am a very qualified editor, with 7 years of publishing experience, but the job market is slim.

I went to a trade school for what I do and it only took me two years and less than 20k to start out making about 25-30 bucks/hour. I'm pretty much capped off at 30/hour with some exceptions but I'm happy with the lifestyle I life at that level, especially considering that the cost of living is fairly low where I live.

I really like my job. It is low stress, easy as hell, and the time spent in school to money (making) ratio is really good in my opinion. However, the problem is that hours are not consistent for me. My pay fluctuates with patient caseload and I never really know from week to week how much work I'll have. I'm interested in potentially pursuing other jobs/careers and am looking for something that is similar, but that would provide me with a more consistent and dependable income.

What are some options? I know that I said work from home in the title, but that's not a requirement by any means.",2019-05-01 22:16:47

Would I be stupid to leave my first job out of college after only two months?,122,bcr8bk,"Basically the company that hired me misled me about every aspect of this job. I was sent to a town (population 400) in the middle of nowhere. A few locations were mentioned during the interview process. This town was never mentioned and isn’t remotely close to any of the places that were mentioned. The offer letter I received had a different location listed on it as well. I was told I’d be receiving paid trips home and per diem. Just before arriving here I was told that employees with my title would not receive per diem or paid trips home.

I work 13 hours a day and I have to work 18 days straight to get 3 days off. I receive no overtime pay or per diem. The 3 days off are intended to be a chance to go home, but much of that time is spent traveling since I’m in the middle of nowhere, and I have to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket to even leave to go home. The closest grocery store is an hour away, and I do t have days off to even go there. I have to go right after work and it’s a 3 hour ordeal. I have to spend an entire night just to get groceries. I’m not getting enough sleep and I don’t have enough time to eat. 

I don’t see how these conditions are sustainable for the next year. Would I be stupid to leave this situation after only two months here? It just doesn’t make sense to me. I could find another job without too much difficulty that pays approximately the same salary for half the work hours in a much better location. What should I do?

Edit: I’m a field engineer. Commercial construction. Hours are typically long, but not like this. I have many friends who work half the hours as me and are paid just as much. Also I have a degree in civil engineering, so there are multiple career paths I could decide to pursue.",2019-04-13 17:48:35

What's the reasoning behind paying new hires significantly more than current employees?,121,ag6mxj,"So you've probably already heard about the saying ""if you want significant pay rises, you need to switch jobs"" which means companies. I understand that you as a company sometimes need to pay new hires more to be able to acquire them and I also get that you won't be giving out raises for current employees left and right to keep the costs in check when the incumbents aren't pushing and seem rather content with their pay. But what I don't get is: If an employee is performing well and communicates he's seriously dissatisfied with his/her salary, why would you let him leave and hire a new guy with lesser experience even though you have to pay him an above average salary to attract him and it will take months or even years until he's completely on board and knows all the processes. What's the benefit of that from a company's perspective?",2019-01-15 11:08:20

I ended up having a discussion with this person the day after I posted. She told me she feels like she is not getting enough work and not helping out enough. I listened to her and said something to the effect of, ""I understand how you feel, we were in an onboarding phase when you first came on, but I'm actively going to start delegating more work to you, thank you so much for coming to me with this."" I did two things: A. I began putting out new and interesting projects to my team via email to see who would jump on the work. These were items we had kept on the back burner that no one had been able to pick up because of capacity. B. I delegated work to her early and often, with a ton of clear detail, boundaries, reasoning, and process, offering her support every step of the way. 

She did not offer to do one project I put out to my team, and every project she completed that I delegated to her was done late and poorly, even with 2-3 weeks notice. It seems she only wants to be included in strategic initiatives and big picture items. Unfortunately, that is not her role at this time. I am going to need to have a longer conversation with her about her goals and how to reach them. Thanks for all the input. ",2018-11-16 00:17:10
I turned in my two weeks notice and was assigned a project with the instructions to “finish before I leave”. It’s going to be at least 80 hour weeks. What do I do?,121,9k8e7j,"So my company is suffering from catastrophically horrible leadership.

Everyone got sick of the mismanagemt and all bailed in the last six months and they haven’t been replaced with any sense of urgency. 

I turned in my two weeks on the same day as the other engineer. They told him to only work one week and then escourted him off the property. It was super petty. My supervisor dropped a huge project on my desk and told me to finish it, by myself, before I leave.

Is it really worth it to take a low paying job in a field I think I might actually enjoy?,118,ba464m,"E: wow, can’t believe the amount of responses this has gotten. Thank you all for taking your time to try and offer help. I’ve been give a lot to think about and consider and can’t thank you folks enough.

I’ve applied to a job in a field I’d likely love (pro baseball) but it only pays $30k salary and it’s 2,000 miles away, where I know nobody. I went to school for sport management and haven’t found a full time job in the industry since I graduated in ‘17. I work a shitty job I don’t like that I consider to be a “fill-in” job, where I also make 30k and live in an area that has a much lower cost of living while I search elsewhere. I’m just floating along with no purpose or direction really, applying to jobs here and there in all sorts of different fields...though they all pay more than in sports. And student debt is a mother.

I literally have no idea what I’m doing or want to do with my life! I hope you folks have a good Saturday. 

Oh, and just for clarification: I am well aware and have been since I starting pursuing a career in sports that it’s a terribly low-paying field, especially at entry level. But then I became an adult and found myself actually having shit to pay for, so it all just adds to the uncertainty and indecision about working in sports.

"My brother is turning down his dream job, how do I persuade him to make a leap of faith?",121,auyyl7,"This is not for myself, this is for my brother, but he’ll never post or ask for help, so I’m doing it for him.

My brother is 18 years old, left school last summer, and has been working in a high end fashion/furniture store as a Sales Assistant. He has been there for over half a year now and is thinking of his next step. He enjoys the fashion industry and ideally would want to continue and grow in this field, ideally into more the Design side than just Retail. Retail is a cool start, but it's low pay, hard work and weekend shifts. Not ideal.

Through a networking event at work he got in contact with a Senior Manager from Chanel, and after asking my brother to sketch a super quick design and talking for a good hour, he invited my brother to a week long trial.

The catch? The company is in Paris, France, and we live in London, UK. My brother loves French culture, listens to French music, but his French is basic at best.

The week long trial would be a working interview of sorts during Paris Fashion Week, which my brother has been going on about for years, for a full time job, again in Paris.

My brother, after thinking for some time, has decided not to go. He feels he isn’t ready and is too young. However I feel this is lack of confidence and nerves talking, this is literally his dream job and even if they don’t hire him after the week, the expense of being there for 1 week is surely worth the experience and putting it on your CV? I also think that since he’s in his first serious relationship, and works with the girl in his current workplace, that could be swaying his opinion, although he denies this.

What do you guys think? Should I butt out or push him to leap for this? I understand he's young, but this company is on another level to others and this could be a one-in-a-million chance.

TLDR: 18yo Brother is turning down his dream job designing at Chanel because they’re in another country and he doesn’t feel ready.",2019-02-26 14:34:03

Feel like giving up on your dream job?,118,bxbv92,"This will be long, but I wanted to tell you guys my experience to motivate you! More than a year ago I asked for advice here and some people were so kind! I actually saved some of the advice people sent me and read it when times got tough.

Here is what happened. In 2017 I moved from my home town (ended a 10 year relationship because he didnt want to move with with) because I was hired by a big tech company in another city. It was my dream job, I worked with tech and wanted a carreer boost and an experience in a big company. Five months later my whole team was laid off. Yes. It lasted five freaking months.

There I was, lonely and jobless. I had terrible depression, suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking there was something wrong with me. Maybe I was being punished by my ambition? But anyways, I was in need of a job I went through all my contacts, scheduled meetings with everyone, reached people I never met on Linkedin. Asked for referrals. Finally I was hired by a small start up 5 months after being fired.

But I still wanted to pursue my dream and I kept trying. A friend of a friend who worked at another big tech company offered me to introduce me to someone he knew who worked there. I grabbed coffee with that person who was simply very happy to help me. He referred me, I went through a long interview process and they made an offer!!!

Anyways, just to tell you: I just started at this company and I am way more passionate about the role I am in today than the role I was fired from. I get to actually make a difference now, since I am part of a small team inside this company.

Anyways, DONT GIVE UP! And dont be ashamed to ask for help, contacts, referrals. Go after what you deserve! And I hope you all have the best of luck :)
Edit: sorry for the typos and everything. I am not american and I wrote this very quickly.

Ps: I had no network in the city I moved to. I just kept introducing myself to people and making my way in like a crazy person. Referrals are very helpful, so that’s what I was looking for.

Gave two week notice and they offered me an ABSURD amount of money to stay - Too good to be true?,118,9lxuzu,"Been at the same company since I was in college (4.5 years) started off doing payroll, followed by billing/accounts receivable and now I am transitioning into more of an accounting role.  I applied for a job with the state and somehow landed it.  It was a 45% raise, amazing benefits, pension etc.

I gave my two week notice and my boss and upper management were devastated.  They had big plans for me as I was supposed to take over my bosses role but between the low pay and lack of new work being given to me I had to get out.

They offered me an insane amount of money ($90k vs $71k at the state) and they will pay for me to get my masters degree.  My friends are saying this is a no brainer and to take the money, whereas my family thinks the state makes sense given the pension and job security.  

I don't know why I am so skeptical but $90k is such an absurd amount of money for someone my age and with my experience, especially given what I do isn't complicated whatsoever and I can probably do it in 30 hours.  We do not have a 401k which is why the pay is so significant and if all goes well I will be taking over for my boss who makes over 200k with a bonus (2-3 years away).

"I fucked up, am I about to lose my job offer?",113,by04kg,"I'm such a fucking idiot. 


Got an offer. Decent salary, in the middle of the posted range, and first job for me out of uni. Was putting off reading through the legalese of the offer but had seen the salary and was considering whether or not to negotiate it (position was supposed to start Monday). Manager calls to see if I had any questions, and I just confirm I'm excited, haven't read through the offer fully but will be coming in Monday.


After verbally accepting I start second-guessing myself and reading online about how I should try to negotiate. So I send an email saying I'd read the offer and wanted to talk about base salary yada yada counter-offer. Except after thinking about it in the past few hours I realized that I verbally accepted and was basically just trying to selfishly get a couple thousand more out of them - and really it's my own damn fault for not looking over the offer and responding before the last minute. 


Anyways then I panicked and sent them an email apologizing for making the counter-offer after accepting, that I'd been building up nerve to negotiate and had a momentary lapse of judgement and was sorry for putting them in an awkward position at the last minute + hoped everything would be okay moving forward. No response yet. How fucked am I? Am I overreacting? Are they going to rescind my offer? How bad of an impression am I making?

I don't feel like I am intelligent enough for my job should I leave for an easier job?,114,bud3vo,"I have always lived by the fake it till you make it motto. I was always just chugging along, moving positions, getting new jobs. I feel like my past two jobs I am just not smart enough. I interview well because I used to be a recruiter so I feel they like me because I know what to say, then I am struck with imposter syndrome the moment I start. Even my current boss commented on how out of all the resumes she's seen mine was the only one that was even structured normally, again just because as a Recruiter I knew what companies were looking for....

My last position I was a manager and had 1 person work under me. I only lasted at the job because NO ONE ever checked on me. In fact, since day 1, they handed me a computer at IT and no one ever even told me my job. I got bored of the faking it and really wanted more purpose to my job. I took a job in a entirely new industry and I am really struggling with my confidence in my intelligence. I feel like Im not worth my salary although the same as my last job because I feel like Im not as experienced as they wanted. I was honest not knowing the industry and although I've worked the same role, same title, in 3 other industries, what they want from me is extremely different and they actually watch you like a hawk judging your moves.

I feel like Im put on the spot so much and my mind just goes completely blank. I am supposed to ask questions and I just can't even possess a thought to ask. So lately I have been thinking maybe I really should have stayed at a lower level job. It just couldn't pay the bills so I had to take harder jobs to make ends meet at the time. Im just not smart. I feel like my IQ is just maxed at what it understands. I read a lot, always trying to learn and improve but just feel like I am capped.

I feel like a fraud in my life. Like someone will realize Im not smart and let me go. Even in school, I barely passed classes in highschool and was a D average student. College I did really well and got mostly As and Bs but that wasn't easy. I worked 10x as long to be half as good as the rest of the class. I feel it so much in real life where simple things and intelligent conversations are so difficult for me.

What really spiraled my confidence was being at a bar and just chatting with the bartender and he mentioned how he was smarter than me. I asked how could he tell, he said just by the way I talk in conversation....it was confirming everything I was thinking all along. (We had been talking about 4 hours so it wasn't out of context for our convo)

I've been with my new company now for a month and I just feel fearful everyday they will let me go.

My manager earns $490K/yr while we are paid $30K. What's wrong with this company?,115,78jked,"San Francisco, California

HR accidentally released our manager's W2 so now everyone in the office knows he gets paid $490,000 a year.  This guy plays Pokemon Go all day and doesn't actually contribute, just blows smoke and gets our president (his boss) excited over nothing.  He has been with the company for over a decade and has somehow convinced his boss that he is indispensable, when in actuality he just takes credit of our work. 

The president of the company pays everyone $60,000 a year as base.  Initially, he promised fat bonuses but has failed to deliver for 2 years, even though the company is profitable.  There is no 401K and no salary raise, so my colleague who has been here for 7 years still only earn $60,000 base.  The company dangles a carrot in front of us, saying if we work hard we will eventually be rewarded, and unfortunately the naive new blood buys this lie, which means despite the super high turnover, new grads are still eager to knock on our door.  This just encourages the president to continue his way because he gets away with it.


The job is unfulfilling and involves being deceitful to our customers, so I feel my soul dying a little each day.  The positive aspect is there is no micromanagement, so I am left alone.  I use this time to study and read, and work only about 1 hour each day (it's a 9 to 6 full time job).  The job market here is rough, and with so many of my graduate class still out of work, I *think* I should feel fortunate to have this job, but I don't.  

What would you do in my situation?

CRAZINESS OCCURRED ON FRIDAY. What would you guys do in my shoes??,110,93479b,"HEY. I'm going to speak in short sentences to be as concise as possible. Let's go:

25yo male. Bachelors in management, MBA in business admin. Working in healthcare for the past 3 years. Year 1 was an IT analyst (basically just desktop support). Year 2 was IT manager (more desktop support, telling specialists to handle tickets, meet with heads to see if IT could help, nothing special tbh). Year 3 (now) I am an account supervisor for another healthcare company. They are all about enrolling doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers into insurance plans. I just make sure my team of 7 completes their tasks and sends out those applications to enroll providers. Nothing special again. I love IT because I love fixing shit and researching new processes, so this job kind of sucks because its very... ""lame"" to me. **OK NOW THE CRAZY PART BEGINS. You need to know the aforementioned into before proceeding:**

Director pulls me in on Friday. Has a piece of paper in her hand. She's smiling and looks at me and asks ""can you explain this?"". I look at the paper. Its my resume which I LEFT IN HER PRINTER SOMEHOW. FOR AN INTERVIEW I HAD EARLIER THAT SAME DAY. I mention straight up that im interviewing. And that its for the money. Really. I said it straight up. She laughs and says she completely understands. She asked how much they offering. I said 75K. I'm currently making 60K. I also tell her my 2 hour daily commute is brutal. She says she'll talk to the CEO and get back to me MONDAY (the next business day). 10 MINUTES AFTER THIS CONVERSATION, she calls me in and says we would like to offer you 75K to stay, and up to 2 days to work from home.

Guys, my mind was blown away. I have this job that I am not passionate about paying me a very nice amount (and its very easy - almost a joke), while I'm here looking for something in IT because well... I like IT. But now I'm thinking if I should just stay.

SOS  
  
**UPDATE^1:**  The other company has offered 73K. My current company is offering 75K + WfH. Welp.  
**UPDATE^2:**  Next day. Leaning towards staying. Think I should push for more money???

I keep changing jobs and I love it... but should I?,112,b3qyb8,"I switch jobs quite frequently. My first post-college job I was there for 2 1/2 years, my next job I was there for 1 year, and after that I've only been working at this company for 6 months and I'm already ready to move on. I've been making large salary jumps and I make a lot of money for only being 25 years old, which was always a big reason I would change jobs. But I also get very bored at different jobs very easily. Additionally, all my job changes have been in-line with my career goals.

&#x200B;

"Left banking job on bad terms after 6 years and have done nothing for over a year - how to approach CV, recruiters, etc?",112,avpim5,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the ""external perspective""), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the ""personal perspective"" below. I was thinking of simply saying ""personal/family issues I had to deal with""

&#x200B;

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we ""parted ways"" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

&#x200B;

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my ""leave"" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now. I've finally found the motivation to get a damn job so today is literally the first time I've logged into LinkedIn in years!",2019-02-28 12:13:46
Thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn updated while you’re working at a company?,106,b8s5x1,"TL;DR: coworkers are cracking jokes and judging me for marketing myself on LinkedIn. It’s become pretty obvious that I’m doing it because I’m looking for another job. What are your thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn up to date while you’re currently working at a job?

I’ve been at my current company for about a year now and I’m looking to relocate to a new city and find a new job there. Of course, nobody at my current company knows that I’m trying to find a new job, but I’ve been doing everything I can to make myself a better candidate in the meantime.

I’ve been updating my LinkedIn and trying to make myself more marketable by adding a professional looking headshot as my profile picture, updating my work experience with some bullet points about my work, and writing a cheesy bio about my skills and what I love about my industry. Also I’ve been getting some certifications through LinkedIn learning and adding those to my profile as well.

Some of my coworkers have seen the changes on my LinkedIn and tease me about it. They make jokes about how it’s suspicious that I’m putting so much effort into branding myself and they hint that I’m trying to leave the company. It’s really starting to get annoying. Yeah, I am branding myself because I’m looking for a new opportunity, but they have such a negative and condescending tone about keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date. They make it seem like anyone who cares about their LinkedIn image is a traitor to their current company.

I think that’s really annoying because now that I’ve taken time to update my LinkedIn, I realized this is something I would do even if I wasn’t considering leaving my current company. If you’re in any type of career, your public image is so important now that the internet plays a huge role in everyone’s lives. Any single person you meet can take 2 minutes to look at your LinkedIn and learn a lot about you, and I think that’s really underrated. 

I hate how I am being judged so negatively by my coworkers for updating my LinkedIn and marketing myself as best as I can. Yes, I admit they’re right about me doing it because I’m looking for other opportunities, but i don’t think updating your LinkedIn in general for the sake of keeping your career progression up to date is such a bad thing. It’s such a taboo subject in the workplace and I really don’t think it should be. ",2019-04-03 05:05:04
Is it a valid reason to resign due to a toxic work environment?,109,ah58zq,"My manager has never had an issues with my performance or attendance. I have stayed with the department because it is in the industry related to my career interests, the job market is rough and I needed experience.


I am exhausted from being targeted by co workers and working in an environment where I'm made sure everyday that I am not welcome. I filed a harassment complaint with HR and everyone was required to complete workplace harassment training. I am tired of documenting.

Management is rejecting my requests to become part time or taking leave of absences. I cannot continue to work in a poisoned environment. I don't have another job ready (even though it would be ideal). 

I hate that there will be a gap in employability and
its obvious that I have to leave but I'm hesitant:
- should I state my reason for leaving due to toxic environment (edit: lack of fit), detailing everything I've done to resolve the situation without any luck. 
- would management and hr provide references for my future employment?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight. I did what was best considering my circumstances. This is a learning experience in my career development, I'm also networking and also learning from other experienced professionals as well as upgrading my skills. ",2019-01-18 03:38:23

Is 29 too old to go back to school to change careers?,108,9sn8i9,"I'm currently employed as a personal care home administrator and as bad as it might sound I just don't find the work fulfilling on a personal level.

"My boss is making it mandatory that he follow all employees on all social media platforms because of a ""new SEC compliance rule"". Is this allowed?",109,byyo70,"So pretty much my post title. Sorry for formatting - currently on mobile 


I work for a financial advisory company and today my boss came around and said its now mandatory that he follow everyone on social media to ""make sure we arent promoting *company name* on our personal accounts"". 
To me, this seems like a pretty large breach in my personal life privacy? To the point I'm thinking of deleting my social media platforms. Not necessarily for the sake of me posting inappropriate things, but moreso because I dont want my boss knowing about my personal life in any regard? I keep my personal and work life as separate as possible? 

Is this actually a new rule? Is this allowed in general in any work place? I've searched for SEC compliance rules specifically about social media and everything that comes up is just about the businesses social media platforms.. not the individual employees?

Also, if there is a better sub to post this on, can you please direct me there? I'm not sure the best place to ask this.

Thank you in advance!!!

Update: first I want to thank everyone that has weighed in here. Mostly everyone has been really helpful and helped me figure out this place is probably not for me. Hes always been a little bit on the inappropriate side and this just pushed me over the edge I think... I'm going to keep my eyes open to new positions in the area.

 I decided if he persists on this issue I'll deactivate my Facebook and tell him I deleted my snapchat. I think it's easier to hide a snapchat than a Facebook because you need the actual snap username and mine isnt recognizable as being me. Also I'd deactivate my facebook rather than change my name or block him because I have a really really uniquely spelled name and theres like 2 profiles that come up when you search for me (my own and one I had in mide school lol) 

I've not accepted any of his requests and have not added him on anything, it's almost the end of the work day and he hasn't come to me about it or sent any emails through the office asking. I'll give it a few days and if he asks for my snapchat I'll let him know it's been deleted. Aside from snapchat I only have Facebook and LinkedIn. When I first started at the office he tried to friend request me on Facebook and I declined it so now he cant add me and I cant add him. 
A random coworker sent me a friend request minutes after my boss came into my office and asked for my social media information. Idk if that's relevant but I figured I'd make it part of the update.

Just landed a job earning $140k/year. I don't have a college degree. Should I go back to school and finish?,105,a4rmzg,"I have been working in the tech industry for about 10 years and have worked my way up through a few different software engineer positions. I originally attended 2 years at a university studying computer science, but had to stop going to school and start working due to health issues my mother was having at the time. I had no choice but to live independently, and I couldn't afford to take on more student loan debt to keep going to school so the only option was to work.

10 years later, I still haven't finished a degree because I haven't had much incentive to do so. I kept getting raises, was able to buy a home, pay off all my debt, invest in my retirement, and generally live a pretty good financially secure life. However, it still bothers me that I don't have that piece of paper. No one has ever asked if I actually hold a degree, and I have worked alongside people with master's degrees who were far less capable than me. For some reason, however, it still makes me very insecure.

Going back and finishing a CS degree certainly wouldn't be so that I could increase my earning potential (or will it?). Also, no companies have ever denied me a job citing lack of a 4 year degree.

If I do go back to school, I'd probably have a solid 2 years (60 credit hours) to finish. Not all of my credits transferred to a local university, and I didn't take all of the undergrad general studies years ago because I was more interested in CS at the time.

Financially speaking, it will probably cost between $15-20K to finish. It would also take me for freaking ever because I am working full time and would only be able to take a couple night/online courses (6 credit hours max) per semester.

So, what are your thoughts? Should I go back and finish this degree? What will it really provide besides being an expensive way to curtail my own insecurities?",2018-12-10 04:55:41
What in the world can I do with two LibArts degrees besides burn them for warmth?,108,a2lzzv,"tl;dr version: I was the first person in my family to go to college, so I was unprepared and I panicked. I majored in English and History (yeah, I know). I graduated in 2008 right as the economy tanked, panicked again, and entered grad school...as a history major. Yeah, I KNOW. I wanted to remain in academia and go into teaching at the university level, but full-time tenure-track jobs in the humanities are so hard to come by that unless you go to a top tier school, you're pretty much SOL. So now I'm in my early 30s and sitting on two utterly useless degrees, and besides stepping out into oncoming traffic, I have no idea what to do with my life and all this wasted time and money.   


I live in the economic wasteland that is West Virginia. I've applied for what feels like every job in every surrounding state that would be a relatively ""easy"" move, but on the rare occasion I ever get an interview, I never get the job. I can't afford to just pack up and move without having a job in the place first; no one's going to let me sign a lease just on the promise that \*maybe\* I can find a job once I get there.   


If I apply for jobs I know I'm overqualified for, I never hear back. No surprise there. But I also very rarely hear back from jobs I'm actually qualified for. I don't even get excited when I get an interview request anymore because I know what's going to happen. And it's not like I go into them like Eeyore or anything; I'm actually a very bubbly, friendly person in real life and I carry myself well in interviews. I'm just never good enough.   


So what do I do when I've already so thoroughly hosed myself here? Going back to school isn't an option. I'm already up to my eyeballs in debt because I took out loans in grad school to help take care of my parents. First gen college student, remember? Easy money when your family's never been above the poverty line. So what can I possibly do to make this situation better? I've been writing and editing online for almost 10 years now, but I have nothing to show for it; it's all been in content mill hell sites and ghostwritten, so I don't even have a byline anywhere. I've worked off and on as a legal assistant in a law firm this past year (yay for layoffs) and my sometimes-boss has told me I need to consider law school because apparently I have a natural knack for it, but again: I am NOT adding another $100k+ to my student loan tab. I can't pay the ones I've already got. I've thought of making a niche in legal writing and turning that into a freelance business, but I don't think I'm cut out to be my own boss.   


How do I try to salvage whatever's left of my life without going back to school and taking on even more debt? I want to help people. I know that. I really think grant writing would be right up my alley. I've volunteered as a grant writer before and really enjoyed it, but getting a job in the field without the marketing/communications/statistics background most commonly wanted seems impossible.   


I'm just feeling really down and desperate and could use a gentle nudge (or a shove, whatever) in the right direction.",2018-12-03 08:24:38

Well paying jobs with less human interaction ?,100,arog7s,"Hi guys. 

I'm pretty bad at human interaction. I'm an introvert, awkward and distant, and I always have trouble putting on the professional client-facing face that my coworkers do. I ended up in digital marketing and 2 years in, there's not much people interaction but as my career progresses I know there will be (i.e. company expands or if I join another company). I'm also losing interest in my current digital marketing role. So I'm not really looking forward to how my career progresses. 

I'm rethinking the path I'm on. I'm 27 (med school drop out, got lost a bit) which I feel is already too old to rethink things(I guess I'm comparing to my peers) but I really want to enjoy what I do. **Money** is a huge factor and I would like to reach a good salary fast.

A part from just going with it and getting used to people, is there a route I can take to a well paying marketing job with less interactions, or does it get worse from here? :/

If there's any other less/no people, well paying career paths, please do share. I am truly lost because the people thing is an issue for me :( and I'm bad at it no matter how much I try. I am willing to study subjects on the side if it means I can find something I enjoy. 

About me: 27f, I like research, being pedantic about little things (lol), environmental conservation, science, art, how the universe works, and the theoretical side of marketing.

Boss asked me pour/serve him water - is this appropriate in a professional workplace?,104,8ewob0,"So I'm kind of at a loss for words. I serve as a Chief of Staff for my boss, but at times he treats me like an entry level assistant \(or even intern\). I've been asked to get coffee, which I feel a bit overqualified for but have learned to bite my tongue, but I've also been asked to do more and more waitressing type duties like clean up his office once he leaves \(he leaves his trash/old cups of coffee etc and I've been told that I'm supposed to wash them.\) One time, he left his old coffee cup in the conference room and a senior associate took the dirty cup and left it on my desk \- with the assumption that it was my duty to go clean it. I have over 10 years of experience and my job is far from entry level. I have really downplayed how much this has bothered me but this past week I was called into his office and he asked me to pour him water and bring it over to him. He was only a few feet away.  I felt that it was very demeaning. I mean, we are in 2018 \- I'm not a secretary from the 60's. Am I wrong thinking this is inappropriate?

Feeling overwhelmed at work and actually broke down in public today - What should I do?,103,bag06e,"Hi everyone,

Posting here because I don't know where else to go, and I'm too embarrassed to tell the full story to my family and friends.

I recently started a new job after graduation, and it's been about 3 months. Yet things don't seem to be getting better.... I'm just getting so tired. I bring my work home almost every day, and even then, it seems like I'm still not finishing fast enough.

They say the team you work with makes a hell of a difference - thats definitely true. I have an amazing team, but a manager who's a lot more particular and brutally straightforward about it..... it's been a bit harder in that aspect. I feel like I've fucked up, almost every single day. Every day there's a new crisis, even over the weekends because everyone still actively emails over the weekend.... I couldn't take it. Broke down at the dinner table today in front of my boyfriend's family after half a day of replying nasty emails and I'm utterly mortified.

Has anyone else here faced a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or find someplace better? Today was the first time in this three months that I've genuinely considered applying somewhere else.... I don't know anymore.",2019-04-07 16:01:21

Today they fired my 83yr old Grandma from work what can she do?,104,8zqihc,"So would hopefully come across some legal or insightful advice on what a sad situation of 37 loyal years to a company only to get booted. (Illinois)

She worked for this company 37 yrs, never called off unless it was an emergency rare, always on time unless there was a valid problem which was less than 10, and today they gave her the boot.

The company claimed she fell asleep a month ago wrote her up but she did not sign it because she did not agree with it, and she supposedly fell asleep again on Friday, however no video/image/witness proof exists, **having this job provided the insurance she needs (blue cross bs and Medicare part a part b) , she enjoyed feeling needed, she enjoyed her coworkers,** brightened her sprits and for them to just boot her was malicious.

Apparently their insurance went up because of her age is what an insider mentioned to me, which if true seems to be a plan of action to get rid of her.

**The saddest part that broke my heart was, as she was let go they told her to leave and do not say goodbye to anyone as she left, treating her like she was a criminal of some sort, who does that!!!! If they did nothing wrong, I would at least after 37 yrs of loyalty let her say her goodbyes, how rude.**

Is there any possibility of something to do? The insider mentioned to go to the company for her and ask for the visual proof of what they claim happened, anything other, my mind is so wrapped up in comforting her I can't think.

Thank you in advance to those who can provide some help, if you can't please vote this up so it can get to the eyeballs of someone that can maybe.",2018-07-18 03:06:26
"My degree is useless, I can't get far in my job and I'm scared to pursue my passions. What do I do next?",104,b59ed0,"Tldr at bottom

I like biology and heathcare but am very shy and introverted. Wanted to work in a lab but only really determined this after graduating. My 2.2 in Human Bioscience won't really get me anywhere.

Now I work in a NHS lab as an assistant but can't go beyond band 4 (caps at about £24k/yr) without another degree. Hated my time at uni which is putting me off going back. Job is okay but even in this small group I get a lot of bad anxiety (I worked in retail before). 

I'd like a career where I

 • Don't have to do night shifts. I like to be fairly consistent

 • Avoid working in huge groups or with the general public

 • Work from home or work a 4/3 week. I'd like to have children in the future

I don't mind earning less for a job that's near perfect but I'd like to earn enough for my partner (still a student) and I to live comfortably in the south of England.

Things I'm considering

 • Cake baker/decorator. I love making and decorating cakes. I make a good sponge but my decorating still needs work. It's fun but I'm scared of messing up especially when someone paid for my services. On a related note opening a cafe has been considered too.

 • Indie game development. I started a Unity/C# course on Udemy and I really enjoy doing pixel art. I've made games with my partner before and it's fun but I know it's not very reliable

 • Something programming related. I did computing for a short while during my a levels and loved programming but didn't enjoy the theory. Don't know much about software development as a career

Tldr 20-something graduate who loves baking and pixel art wants career that doesn't increase social anxiety but pays okay. 

Sorry for so much information but I really need help!

How do I go about telling new employer that I need time every two weeks for therapy?,96,bism3a,"So without getting into too many details, I go to therapy every other week for a variety of mental health issues.

I am starting a new job in two weeks. My current employer and I have a great relationship so I have been open with my boss about it and time wise it works out well because I don't go into work until 10 am (therapy at 830). This new job is 9-5 but like my current job has a lot of night time events and overtime where consistently scheduling therapy in the evening is very difficult.

&#x200B;

Would it be out of place for me to ask for the same 10-6 traditional work schedule before i even begin? 9-5 in my field is rare to begin with because of all the evening and night time events (I work in college student affairs). Most official hours are either 10-6 or 11-7.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your responses everyone! I start in two weeks I will see what happens.

"A specific question: Has anyone had a failed figure skating, arts or sports career?",96,b7le7y,"I wanted to be a professional figure skater when I grew up. When I was 7 my coach discovered that I was talented. I landed doubles and almost triples by the time I was 8. However, due to a combination of not understanding how life works, my parents discouraging me, and growing a backside after puberty (for lack of a better word)...I ended up not practicing enough. By the time I was 12, I wasn’t improving fast enough and quit. 

To this day I don’t love anything else as much as I love skating. I wonder what would’ve happened if I’d practiced more. If my parents hadn’t said so many discouraging words. My dad especially had a temper. He would lash out at me and make me feel worthless. My parents would tell me I’d never be anything, this was just a phase and would yell at me so much before my lessons that I’d get upset. Then when I got home they’d give me so much work to do and tell me how selfish I was. 

I remember all the other parents who would cheer their kids on at competitions. Who would encourage their kids to practice. Some parents were even willing to homeschool their kids so they could pursue their dreams. I watched kids who weren’t as talented as me surpass me because they had worked harder, largely because their parents supported them. 

Maybe if I had those parents, I would’ve made it to nationals. Maybe I would’ve ended up skating for a traveling show. Two of my coach’s students made nationals. One of them wasn’t as talented as me to begin with but had really nice parents and worked really hard. This makes me think I really did have a chance. 

I’ve tried skating for fun and thought about getting a coaching license. But I’d be bitter about my wasted potential.

I graduated college a few months ago and I am starting my first job as a mental health specialist next week. It’s an amazing opportunity I’m very thankful for. I still resent my parents for having discouraged the one thing I loved more than anything else. I still think about what could’ve been and the fact that I might not find anything I like better. I hear a song, or it’s cold out, and I want to go ice skating so badly and there’s no other way for me to let it all out but I can’t. I have this gut feeling that I won’t find anything better. And my life is just not going to be the best it could’ve been. 

This is a very specific experience, but I’m wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? If you ended up finding a way after an athletic career ended? ",2019-03-31 11:05:32
"Five years since degree, two years unemployed. Any ideas for moving forward?",97,a63f8l,"27 years old by now and my self confidence has never been lower. Been contemplating suicide several times and should've probably sought after therapy of some sorts, just to give you an idea of my mental state for the last couple of years.

&#x200B;

Basically couldn't land a job after my bachelors degree due to lack of experience and poor social skills. Went to several interviews, but they always choose someone else. My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end. Keeping up a facade would be impossible for me as I'm an introvert and have a hard time with a severely damaged self image.

&#x200B;

So since my degree I went back to my work full-time at a local industrial production company and worked there for 3 years. My boss would always complement me on helping out and working extra etc, whatever you could wish for as a reference to a next job in a new career. 

&#x200B;

But with time passing by and being stuck with a, to be honest, shitjob even tho I had a degree the field was ""screaming for"", my mental state straight up sank to levels I didn't know was possible. So I quit my job just to break the cycle. All it did was me ending up in a bubble and a far worse depression. 

&#x200B;

Now it's been 2 years and I don't know where to go from here. Should I forget my degree altogether or **have people come back from this at all?** The degree isn't bad, I'm the only one who couldn't get a job as far as I know, even people with worse grades etc. Study a new field?

Did I commit ​career suicide?,97,awb9x1,"Hi everyone,

Created a throwaway account due to sheer embarrassment. I am 26F, living in Toronto. I have 4.5 years of work experience. 4 years with a big financial services company where I was a business analyst and a project manager. I loved working there, however after 4 years I decided to move elsewhere so I could grow. Actually, I was pretty desperate to switch towards the end as my old company started going through a lot of changes. I still loved my job but wanted to move to a place with a better culture.  I got a higher paying job with a promotion with this investment management company. On paper it sounded very cool and I thought I would be doing the exact same things that I loved doing at my old job. However, once I joined, I found out it was far from truth. They had just drafted the role in such a way that I would say yes (the new company reached out to me and was very keen on me joining). I hated being there. I hated doing my job because it wasn't what I signed up for. On top of it, my manager made my life hell. She had no trust in her employees and kept a close eye on my monitor. If I stopped working for a min, she would start questioning me. This was also the time when I was going through A LOT at home. My brother who abused me during childhood moved in with me with my parents. My parents knew what he did to me but still insisted I put it behind me and become the bigger person to improve his life. With the stress from home and work, I got majorly depressed and went into a very dark place. Finally I decided to quit my job after being there for 5 months because I wanted time off for myself.

&#x200B;

It's been a month since then and I managed to kick my brother out. I have been actively applying for roles but I just dont hear back. When I was employed, I was actively applying too and I would hear back from 3/10 places I would apply to. I have a strong background and have worked for Fortune 500 companies only. But now, there are NO replies. I am still depressed and working on myself but it feels like I committed a career suicide by quitting only after 5 months. It makes me look unreliable or that I was fired only after 5 months. I know a month is a short time but 0 replies after having a strong resume is really pulling me down. The only responses I get are rejections. I am trying to look into going back to school also but everything just feels like dead end to me. I don't want to go back to that job I just quit because it was hell working there. Any advice or input would be appreciated. If anyone is willing to review my resume, I would appreciate it a lot as well!

Quit job and want to change career. What steps should I take?,95,bpblae,"Hi all

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I'm 25, and after much deliberation, I quit my job a few days ago. As a brief background, I studied economics at university for 4 years, then upon graduation spent 2 years in investment banking. I quit that job in March to pursue an opportunity at a renewable energy company in an attempt to align my job more with my values, albeit the role was still working within mergers and acquisitions and exhibited the same stressors as my investment banking job. I quit this job a few days ago without much of a plan, although I am in a fortunate enough position to be able to sustain myself for the next year or so.

Reasons I quit: - Work/life balance. Upon graduating, I was full of energy and was not daunted by the long hours that characterise the finance industry. This energy, however, soon disappated. With little personal time, I miss greatly the things I used to do for enjoyment, such as reading, drawing, rock climbing and spending time with friends and family. I also am not motivated by money or status, so I found it difficult to justify continuing my career path. - Changing personality type. Before picking my university degree subject, I took several Myers-Briggs tests and was coming out as a strong INTJ, which to my knowledge would make me suited to finance/analytical type jobs. I took the test several times again recently and I'm now coming out as a strong INFP! Of course, I try not to define myself by four letters, but I think the change in my personality type can go some way to explaining my low mood. Numbers no longer interest me like they used to. I am good at analysing and manipulating data, but I don't see it as the means to an end. Rather, I see analysis as a supplementary tool to further my understanding of how I perceive the world. Spending endless hours in front of a computer screen has really worn me down. I miss having frequent interactions with people and nature and have a preference for honesty/integrity rather than doing all I can to get a deal/project approved. - Mental health. My mental health has taken a huge dent over the past few years and I was approaching breaking point. I began to freeze at work and could not function properly. I believe I have high levels of anxiety and a low mood currently, primarily driven by the career I have pursued up until now. I don't perform well in a high pressure environment.

My high level plan for the future: 1. Take a few weeks out to relax, catch up with friends and begin to try and enjoy life again by doing things I enjoy. I also plan to start seeing a counsellor to discuss the difficulties I am experiencing in relation to my anxiety and low mood 2. Find a low stress, guaranteed 9-5 job that I can coast on until I figure out where I'd like to take my career next. 3. Once I know what I want to do next, take time to go back to school (if necessary) and pursue my ideal career.

What I ask from you: I am quite certain that I want to turn my back on finance, however I am struggling to generate alternative career ideas. I have not developed my skill set outside of finance, so nothing really stands out. I have a preference for a career in which people are the main focus and where there is an element of being outdoors. I'm not overly bothered about utilising my economics degree in some way, as I fear that most jobs that an economics degree lead to do not match my values or personality. Furthermore, I view my degree as a sunk cost so I am not concerned about ""putting it to waste"". I kindly ask you how I should go about determining what career I'd like to pursue, and equally if you have any career suggestions that you think I may like based on this post I would love to hear. I am to retrain for a year / on the job, but taking another 3/4 is probably a stretch too far.

I have made upwards of $75k a year. I just applied as a fish gut processor for minimum wage. Any starting over advice?,92,adoxed,"Long story short, I've moved to a new town 3500 miles away. The market is entirely different, and cost of living much lower, so basically any entry level position has career potential. 

My question is this. How do I submit a Cover Letter for a job that requires ""basic english"" as a -preferred- skill while not seeming over qualified?

As it sits right now I'm stating, basically...

""I'm new to town, looking for steady reliable work, somewhere where I can work my way up while building an honest and professional relationship with a company where hard work and efficiency will be rewarded"" or some variation.

Any advice?",2019-01-08 03:31:01
Hating corp jobs but not sure what else to do?,92,a0f5ry,"I feel as though I am suffocating in the corp world. I dread going into the office and it's not even for a reason other than being trapped and just not happy. I am so bored and yes I can ""switch"" jobs but I already have done that 4x and I just find no fulfillment in these stupid corp jobs. I find myself jealous of labor jobs like the custodians or the landscapers because it's like you have a more tangible impact and can see results of your work. I don't even know if 9-5 even exists anymore because every corp job I've held was always 8-5 and when you commute on top of that, your entire day is gone and energy as well. 

My friends/family just say go back to school or change careers but do people really thing its that simple? When I used to work as a recruiter it was almost just thing stamp that that was ALL I was and even when I networked it was all people wanted me to step into a company as. I hated recruiting and fell into the maybe I could get into HR from being a recruiter once I got in with a company, this has NEVER been the case. 

Now I am at this point were I just can't get myself to go in anymore but whats the alternative? I can't really think of a job that I would enjoy more that would pay decent. Money isnt everything but end of the day, I am alone and can't just not pay my mortgage and I do not have family that could help. 

I hate that I live for the weekends and then the weekends come and its chores and then decompressing from work then going back to work and feels like I am wasting my life. I realize my happiest part of the day is coming home to my dog. It'd be great to work with dogs, but I applied to a few dog places and 1. I don't have experience and 2. Its almost a red flag to places that I am at a high level job wanting to be a dog walker. 

I'm an introvert and every job I look at is so involved with other people and I just want to keep to myself and just complete tasks. I don't particularly have any ""skills"" and just have a bachelors of science in psychology. I have no clue what other alternatives are out there that are feasible. 

I am I know probably everyone else out there wishes that they could just not work or work part-time but I feel like at every job I have, after 1-2pm I just zone out. It's almost pointless to pay me because I have no attention left for the bullshit. I have no problem working hard and used to work 13 hour days back when I supervised a retail store, time flew and I never noticed. Now I just stare at a clock all day watching paint dry because its more interesting than whatever stupid pointless corp assignment I am working on. I wish I had ideas to even start my own business or something but with no ideas, skills or anything I just feel a bit defeated. 

I guess long story summed up, I hate my corp job but wondering what alternative freeing or work from home or on your own schedule jobs that pay decent. Seems like a stupid fantasy but honestly curious does anyone have a job that actually like and enjoy going to?

What's so bad about being a lawyer?,94,b21r54,"A letter to unsure future lawyers


Given to me from my law/legal professor in undergrad. I told him I was on the fence to becoming an attorney, and he sent me this.

Mr. A,

I always tell my students that I am but one side of the coin of the profession of law. There are lot of downsides to this profession. To get there in the first place you have to generally expend a decent amount of money (college, LSAT prep and the actual test, applications etc.). Then you have to take out generally $150k-$250k to actually go to school. Your loans will be at a rate of 6-12% depending on how lucky you are, but in general the interest on those loans is going to be insurmountable unless you get a very high paying job and really sacrifice your quality of life for several years.

Once you've gotten there, the study is unlike anything you've done before - 14-18 hour days are not uncommon. Once you begin to practice, you are exposed to routine long days, verbal and mental abuse from your superiors and clients and all so you can make low 6 figures with the possibility to potentially make it out of the rat race and become a partner. Except, there are generally not enough jobs, despite the glut of attorneys and if you don't go to a top school, those opportunities may not be entirely available. If you do make partner, now you have the responsibility of not only running your cases, but also ensuring that your associates are making money for you and not tanking your case. You work weekends, holidays, birthdays, anniversaries - whatever the case and your superiors or your clients demand. There is high pressure on you to deliver the best possible result to your client, even if that result isn't necessarily possible given the circumstances of the case. Your client's problems become your own problems. You take your work home with you and expose your loved ones to the stress of the job.

If this doesn't sound like something you're prepared to do, then I would suggest not going. But, as I have said, there are upsides and I am generally on the very cynical end of the spectrum for attorneys. I tell you guys not to go because most of you shouldn't go. You don't know who you are, what you want in life, and how you are going to align your strategy to achieve those goals. Asking a 21 year-old to go off and make a decision about the next 40-50 years of their life is honestly a very fraught proposition. I tell students to expose themselves to the law - take law classes, talk to University alumni who are lawyers, go work in a law firm, go sit in on law school classes. Do everything you can to prepare yourself for what it will be like and if you like what you are being exposed to, then by all means, go and enroll. Generally, students don't know why they want to be lawyers - they just assume that it's the next step in their education without asking whether they want to do this job for several decades.

In my 2 years of teaching at university, only 1 student has proven to me that they are prepared for this in every way you should be before going. This is out of several hundreds of students that I have had now. So in that way, I suggest you look at some of these things and take them under advisement. If you enjoy your free time, low pressure etc., this is not a job for you, and that is not a bad thing to say or admit. It takes a very specific type of person to do this work and that doesn't mean that that type of person is a good person etc. It just means they are attuned to the type of life this will be. Every single person I have told not to go who went anyway came back to tell me that they regretted it. That's not to say that you don't come to enjoy certain parts of the job. But if you want to last in this business, you have to love it.

I tell students to take a few gap years and go work and learn about themselves. Go see the world. Go work in our government. Go teach English in another country. Go do the things you always wanted to do because once you become a professional - any kind - those opportunities begin to disappear. I have taken a total of 3 vacations in my 6 years as an attorney and I worked during all 3 of them. Go live your life - the law and law school will still be here if you've done all of these things and still want to go. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Is my boss bullying me?,90,b6v80o,"Update: I handed in my notice today! I feel so liberated! He was super nice to me all of a sudden too


I’ve posted about this before. I was hired as a social media executive (some events involved too) for a small business, reporting into the marketing director. When hired, she told me she would be going on maternity leave, but assured me it wouldn’t be long at all, she would be on call, and the Big boss would be around to pick up certain aspects of her job (which I have no experience in).

Cut to now, she has gone completely awol and we have found out she won’t be etirning until September, so that’s 7 months off! Bear in mind I’m paid a junior salary ($30,000)

I have been piled with a huge amount of work I have no experience in which is very technical, so have admittedly been struggling. As a result, my boss has been shouting at me for my lack of experience and the fact that he has to help with my job.

The other day on the phone, every time I said ‘ok’ to something, he would scream ‘stop saying ok!!!’ at me. 

When he gives me tasks, he also screams at me to ‘stop writing things down!!!’, as apparently I have to soak things in.

Yesterday, we had a meeting and he said he was going to create a presentation as I have a lot to do (and I have no experience of using the spreadsheet that has all the figures- I was actually told to not touch it). He comes into the office 10 mins before the meeting asking what I have prepared, and shouts at me in front of everyone for not preparing something.

He also screamed at me in front of everyone regarding a retainer contract my marketing director signed, but then proceeded to apologise as it was signed before I started.

This on top of him micromanaging everything I do and calling everything myself and my colleagues do shit, is giving me serious anxiety.

The weirdest thing is that he flips from being awful to very nice, so will take us to a really nice lunch after he shouts.

I’m going to hand in my notice mid-May as I seriously cannot take it anymore. I have plenty of savings so don’t really care if I have nothing lined up. I feel guilty about leaving when she’s on maternity leave, but now realise that is not my problem. 

I am also grieving at the moment (lostva family member to cancer) so it’s a struggle.

I’m quite a sensitive person however so don’t know if I’m overreacting? Would be good to hear your thoughts.

TLDR: manager went on maternity leave, I have been piled with work and my boss is screaming at me daily, leaving me with anxiety. But am I being too sensitive?",2019-03-29 12:42:57
Has anyone here ever left an office career for blue collar work?,90,b3j2gz,"Looking back, my favorite job of all time was loading delivery trucks in the morning.  It didn't pay well, but it's always been in the back of my mind that I might enjoy being a delivery truck driver or warehouse worker.   I've been in the office for 4 years now and I just don't know if I can sustain an office job without getting fat, anxious and miserable.   I'm half tempted to reach out to delivery truck drivers in my area, offer to buy them beers or coffees and try to get informational interviews.  I'm not very serious about it yet, but my gut says I should at least give it a try and see what happens.    

Does anyone have any success stories about leaving the office and going into manual labor?  I'm guessing it's not too common, but I thought I'd take a shot.

"Fired from first Career Job, how should I proceed?",89,avj61a," (Cross Posted in personal finance for questions about the pay)

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to ""poor culture fit"" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to ""I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group"" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or ""I was asked to leave for"" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

I'm really lost, I'm really depressed, and I don't know what to do, because at the end of the day, being an engineer was extremely boring, and I didn't like what I was doing, but I'm not really qualified for anything else since I was so early in my career.",2019-02-28 00:12:17
How can I talking to my boss about excessive travel?,90,aipm9q,"Hi all,

I am a software developer for a large consulting firm. I was told during the hiring process that it would require up to 50% travel which I am okay with. However, I am currently on a project that requires me to fly 700 miles to the client site 4 days a week every week. I leave my house for the airport every Sunday at noon and return home every Thursday around 10pm. 

I love my job but the traveling but being away from home for the majority of every week is mentally and emotionally draining. This position is perfect for me in every way except for the heavy travel requirements. My current project will be wrapping up soon and I am trying to decide how to approach the topic of traveling less in the future with my manager. 

My boss is a fantastic person and he really cares about his employees. I feel like I could talk to him about this, but I don’t want it to reflect poorly on me or come across as laziness or insubordination. 

How would you suggest approaching this situation?

I have no Passion?,86,aifubz,"Hey all. I’m switching careers, because I’m very unhappy and burnt out working with older adults.

The problem is I don’t really have any passion. I’m not passionate about anything. There’s things I like doing; reading, listening to music, watching tv, but I’m not passionate about these things. Just things I enjoy.

Should I Quit My Steady Job In Order To Focus On My Mental Health While I Look For Something Better?,89,9rcfqo,"Basically trying to make a long story short, in March I quit a job that put me in a very toxic and unhealthy work environment publicly, and took the first job offered to me in order to get out of the spotlight of 8 months of 24/7 harassment. Now, 8 months later I am the most depressed I’ve ever been, anxiety has completely stripped me of my appetite to the point where I’ve lost 10 pounds in the last two months. Every morning I wake up sick to my stomach because I dread my job. I hate what I do, I don’t care about either industry my job falls in, I am given zero resources from my superiors, with unreasonable expectations. I don’t have a background in this industry. I am so utterly lost. Working home alone stuck to myself all day doesn’t help either.  

For the past two and a half months, the only thought in my brain has been “just quit.” As far as I see it, having no job can’t possibly be worse than this horrible anxiety and depression I feel every day. I don’t have the energy to pursue other work full force, I don’t have the energy to pursue anything creative that would make me happy.  I suppose it would be a bit different if I had officemates to commiserate with, or if I had a partner coming home every night, but the fact is I don’t. I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m afraid that “this is it” for the rest of my life without seeing a way out. And if “this is it” I can be honest and say this is not a life I can survive in much longer.  

I guess what I’m asking is, how irresponsible and stupid would it be to just quit without something solid lined up already? I’ve 7 months of living expenses saved (although I would HATE to deplete my entire savings), and I have a few freelance gigs I’m already working on (nothing that comes remotely close to my current salary, but I wouldn’t go immediately to zero income). 

Quitting would allow me to have the bandwidth to a) search for another secure job I’d be happier with, and b) expand my hustle for freelance work. I guess also c) pursue personal creative things I don’t have time/energy for now.  

I’ve been setting up meeting after meeting after meeting with different companies in my industry, but no one is hiring right now. I’ve learned I have a fabulous reputation, but there just aren’t any openings. But I can’t just wait around. Something in my immediate future needs to change drastically if I’m to keep surviving as I’m just so miserable and unhappy right now.

I keep getting fired from corporate jobs…what is my next career move??,88,b5r4t2,"I am getting really frustrated and disappointed in myself. I am unable to keep a job that pays me enough to make a decent living. I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past. I also have creative talents that I would like to explore further and see if they translate to something I am better suited for. Please let me know if the community could recommend a decent paying career path that would highlight my skills and incorporate some of the things I am passionate about.

I don't want to burn bridges, but at the same time, this offer is too good for me to decline?",91,axerbo,"To give some background context, I work as a project coordinator. I've had some issues at my current company, but I'm acknowledged as one of its top-performing employees. I have glowing performance reviews, and my interactions with management from my direct supervisor all the way to the COO have all been positive. No one has a bad word to say about me. I've made suggestions for significantly revamping some of the processes in our project management office, and by surprise, some have actually been implemented.

However, I've been unhappy for awhile-- while acknowledged as a high-performing employee, I'm paid the same as coworkers who have not received the same accolades. My job description has expanded tremendously, and I've received the same raises -- in both timing and amount -- as colleagues who do less than I do. I was told I won't be promoted to project manager (the next logical step), but project plans, etc. that I've developed are used as templates by more senior members of our PMO. I'm even responsible for training newly-hired project managers on our processes. As a result, I feel extremely disrespected by most of the office's management team. The workplace is also toxic. New employees rarely last more than three months.

On a whim, I answered a LinkedIn message from a recruiter, and to make a long story short, I now have an offer letter in hand from another company. It's a significant pay increase (more than I'd make at my current job if I was left their pay increase schedule). My job title doesn't change, but I'd also be working in an industry with better long-term growth potential and higher salaries overall. While I like the offer and prospect of going to work for this new company, I also have a really good relationship with my current boss. I'd feel bad for leaving him in a bind, but it doesn't make sense for me to stay if my current company doesn't attempt to show that they value me. I also know that if I give them a chance to match, I'm most likely first on the chopping block. Why be loyal to me if I'm not loyal to them?

Why would somebody still hire me when I am 50?,87,bjtoj4,"Let’s face it: the hiring market is not a charity organization, they will take the best / cheapest candidate where they have the best return on investment.
I am now in my 30s, with some decent work experience and I get invited to most of the jobs I apply for. Why would a company receiving 100 applications hire me when I am 50 for a job (not C-level) while they can find somebody in their 30s with the exact experience needed? What do I have to do to be employable then?",2019-05-02 14:11:03
I cry in the office bathroom everydqy. What can i do about the below situation at work?,86,axwty0,"Since January, my social life at work has been horrible. It is impacting my work and I cry in the bathroom at work almost twice daily.

I have tried to think a lot why my teammates are behaving in that manner with me.

Earlier the whole team used to go for lunch together and I was included too. For tea/snacks some groups went together. I would join 2 girls at work. Since past few months, they lied to me that they are not going for tea but they did. They used to spend 30 minutes for tea and lie to me about that. I was fine with it. I tried to ask them for tea myself but they did not include me anymore despite my attempts. 
This has not escalated to lunch. They have stopped calling me for lunch from this Monday. So I have to sit alone the whole day at work. From what I see, one girl did not like me and it seems everyone is supporting and believing what she is telling. I honest have no idea what I have done. I tried to recollect my behaviour and actions and can't seem to think any wrong doing.

Can someone please suggest what I can do? I dread going to work now.",2019-03-06 11:08:56
Do coding boot camps actually get you jobs?,87,aojggz,"I’m 36 and looking to start over in terms of career trajectory.

Job for quiet person who wants to work their way up the ranks?,86,9gb66x,"I'm currently the assistant editor of a small but influential publication in my field of study. It's a small team (3 of us) so there's really no room for upward mobility at this organization; plus, I'm feeling ready to move on, anyway. Most of the job postings I'm interested in are communications/writing/project management/managing editor-type roles. 

The problem is, I'm a rather quiet, introverted person (but not shy). I tend to need a good bit of time and space to think things through and strategize. I enjoy talking to people one-on-one. I can do presentations and structured discussions well. But drop me in a group dinner where everyone is casually conversing and I get stuck in my head thinking about everything that everyone is saying and before long just want to go back to my hotel room and knit. However, I'm apparently pretty good at projecting confidence. On a recent work trip, my supervisor (who I don't work closely with at all) told me, ""You don't really strike me as the type of person who gets stressed out about things."" Which I found surprising and hilarious because that's pretty far from the truth.

Most of the jobs I'm interested in that have room to grow and reach higher, managerial roles require a lot of people skills. And I'm just kind of...awkward.

So my question is two-fold: are people-oriented, higher-powered jobs harder for quiet people, and if so, *what are some good alternative career paths* in the publishing industry or in communications for people like me who like people, and can play the part well, but who generally prefer to work with plenty of time to think and process independently? Also, are management roles harder to get if you're quiet?",2018-09-16 17:59:46

Should I advance my career or live the chill life?,85,byex4v,"I am crisis trying to decide what I should do. Currently I (37m) work a very high paying tech job that allows me to work remotely. I work from home in NYC. I own a house and live with my wife and 2 small kids. There is an in-law unit in the house where my sister and brother in law live. I make my own hours, I have full control over the work I need to do, and I do it well. I grew up in the east coast, I have a good amount of friends and family here, generally speaking life is pretty chill.
That said, I have hit the ceiling on my career. There is no room to advance and at this point it's not all that exciting. Working from home these past 7 years has felt pretty isolating. I miss the workplace community and interactions.
Now I have a job offer at a company in Seattle. It's a Sr position doing what I do now. It would be in the office every day with big expectations to solve some big problems. The total compensation is around the same as my current employer, but the catch is most of it is in salary, where as my current employer it is split between stock and salary. It's a great opportunity to work from an office again and take my career to the next level.
But I am really torn about this decision. Moving and starting anew in a city I don't have a lot of connection to. My wife has a bunch of family in Portland, so that's nice, but I will be moving away from my family. Working from the office means I will have less flexibility in my schedule.
I just don't know what to do. It seems like a great career move, but am I foolish for giving up a pretty easy life for this opportunity. Am I foolish for even thinking about moving away from my friends and family. Nothing is permanent, and we could always leave in a year or two if we aren't loving it.
I just don't know what I questions I need to answer for myself, so that which ever path I choose, either staying with my current situation, or moving west, I won't regret it and I can be at peace with it.",2019-06-09 04:10:10

What am I doing wrong?,81,aubzim,"I’m an older woman with lots of experience in Project management, a job description where there are good opportunities. My skill set is well rounded with lots of Admin. I don’t feel like I’m being disingenuous on my resume, but dates of graduation and a few of my earlier jobs are omitted. I get quite a few interviews, luckily, but I can tell the recruiter or hiring manager is a little unsettled when I come in for a chat. I get a lot of interview experience but that’s about all. No offers. 

I feel like my next move should be to go to an employment agency and lay it all out there, what I’ve been through with this ‘issue’ and see what they say. But since their real mission is to work for the employer, not the applicant, I’m not sure if this will backfire and they won’t waste their time with my application.

What're some good careers for a 53 year old single mother to pursue? (My mom),85,bs7amu," Hi, my mom's 53 and she has really bad arthritis in her hands and hips which she can't get surgery for because she can't miss work. It's gotten to the point where she can't even hold a pencil. I help around the house a lot but she works so much hands on labor that it's terrible. She's working 6 days a week at 2 jobs. Those being a ""chef"" at a local gas station (not really a real chef. She just makes eggs, pancakes, and stuff) and a cleaning lady. She's usually working around 8-12 hours a day counting both jobs and the day she has off, she babysitts my 2 year old nephew. We don't have a lot of money. Our family's income is below 30,000 and I don't want her to stress more when my sister and I leave since there's gonna be more manual labor around the house. I'm about to be a senior come September and my sister's gonna be a freshman too. So I was wondering if there's ANY decent careers she might be able to pursue that'd be cheap and that could possibly work with her schedule? I know it's a long shot, I'm just desperate for her. She's always wanted to be a vet since she loves animals (more than anybody I know), she loves learning about crime, is really into medical stuff, loves helping children and the mentally disabled (since her nephew has autism), and even loves tattooing (she was a tattoo teacher at a VoTech school before the arthritis.) She dropped out of college and always says if she had the chance again she'd finish it. So I just want her to have that chance. Any answer is helpful, she'd love any job that paid decently where she didn't have to work 24/7.",2019-05-23 22:39:44

How do you look for a good team culture?,85,9ehicq,"I'm a programmer.

I've had various programming jobs that paid from about $50k to about $130k.

Money is not very important for me. It's usually already sufficiently high.

I find the team culture to be more important:

* Are the coworkers friendly?
* Is the manager/lead easy going, sharing fun stories?
* Do you have to be on a call with angry clients?

Usually I ace the interviews with my experience, but I don't get a good perspective on what the team culture is like.

I learn about it quite quickly after a few days of working there, and interacting with everyone.

I've gotten very lucky, and very unlucky. (Currently going through the very unlucky phase unfortunately, and looking for a way out.)

How did you break into your first management job?,80,b7ufmz,"Healthcare specifically, but any advice from any field is appreciated!

I have been working in a hospital for 5 years in an allied health career. I’m extremely organized and self-sufficient. When there are workflow changes, or new software additions I always learn quickly and coworkers come to me for help. I get along with everyone but I’m not an extroverted person, and can’t play the office politics game very well. 

There is a girl who started the same year I did who already has a lead position by basically having the social skills to impress the director. She has the same education I do and one less certification than me. She is not respected by coworkers and people have to pick up her slack. How do people just *know* how to work the politics of a job?! 

I am craving more responsibility and don’t want to break into another industry and have to start over in my career. What bachelors degree would be best for me to obtain? I am considering an online healthcare management program. Are there are any other similar degrees that would be beneficial to advancing my career and augment my existing experience?

Right now none of the higher ups have advanced degrees. It’s like a big social club in management and they all moved up the ladder before degrees made much of a difference. Another concern I have is I am 26. What advice does anyone have for a young-ish person looking to break into administration?

I am being asked to train co-workers who are making significantly more money than me. How can I use this opportunity to receive a raise?,85,82qbsl,"As the title states, I am currently being asked to train co-workers who are making ~15$/hr more than me. I'm a welder at an aerospace company (about 400 people work at my site) and I'm currently making 22$/hr after 2 years. I was hired for TIG welding and machining, but shortly after starting I was trained on and passed certifications for resistance seam welding and laser diode welding. Now 2 years later the man who trained me on RSW and LBW has retired and I am currently 1 out of 3 people in the entire site who hold these certifications. It takes 40 hours of training for each process before someone can attempt to take the certification test.

There are 4 senior welders (All of whom have been with the company for 10+ years ) and management has plans for each of them to certify in both RSW & LBW. That's 80 hours of training for each welder. Now this is where I fit in. The other 2 individuals (who are also being paid ~35$/hr) who are certified for both processes are very busy and neither want to spend the time (months) training these other welders. So I am the last option as a source of training for these senior welders.

I'm fine with training people, but I already feel extremely under paid. On top of that I'm being asked to put my own gaining of experience on hold in order to train people who are making far more money than me. I feel pretty stuck. I already mentioned this to my HR rep and she got extremely defensive and basically said I should be willing to train them out of my loyalty to the company.

I study graphic design on the side and used those skills for my job. They never had anyone do this before so it really enhanced the work. I asked during my 6 month review if I could use the material I designed for my portfolio, and my manager said yes.

However, a year later, she found the material I designed for the company on my personal website and I got fired because of this for going against a related policy. 

However, the real reason is because I was unhappy there and my boss and I didn’t have a good relationship as I felt she was very autocratic and was not open to change or my input. There was many times she would
dismiss my ideas. There was a few times we had conflict/tension which is why I believe I was let go. Actually, a week before I was fired, I voiced my concern to hear about not feeling I have any input or that my opinion was valued, and a week later, she fired me. HR also told me in the termination meeting that I outgrew the role.

I unknowingly struggled with dyslexia while in college and graduated with a terrible GPA. What can I do to prove to graduate school that I deserve to be there?,81,a3wdkd," I went to a top ten public University in the US and graduate with a Chemistry degree (Bachelor's) (GPA = 2.2)

It took me six years to graduate with that degree (including one year that I was academically dismissed and later reinstated)

I struggled mightily the entire time.

My first two years, I keep failing and repeating classes just to get by.

My third year, I was academically dismissed from my university.

I returned the fourth year and decided that I am going to live and breath chemistry and nothing else.

I woke up, eat breakfast, and study chemistry. Then I go to classes and study chemistry between classes. (I eat lunch while studying.) After that, I eat dinner and go to bed. Rinse and repeat.

When I said ""study"", I mean 80% reading (textbook, online papers from the professors, etc.) and 20% doing homework, lab report, etc.

Reading is just so time and energy consuming. I have to spend so much effort making sure that I am reading the right words that I often get ""lost"" in the text and forget what the text was saying.

I wasn't just my chemistry major classes that I was struggling with. I struggled with the general elective classes (literature, ethnic study, etc.)

My advisers sent me to skill classes (note taking classes, time management classes, etc) and they didn't help.

Finally, in my last term, I talked with my professor in a class I was struggling with.

I describe extensively how hard I try and how much time I spend studying. What he said changed my life.

He said that I probably have dyslexia and that his son has that.

I changed the way I study. I stopped retyping my notes after class, and instead, record lectures for later listening. Instead of reading texts, I use text to speech software to listen to text.

I initially thought that I would surely fail that class. I, instead, ended up with a B+.

In another class, I earned my first ever A+ in college.

Furthermore, with the change in the way I study, I feel that I didn't have to work as hard to earn a good grade. I was able to retain the material more easily and naturally.

It's a shame that I didn't figured this out earlier. (When I was using the more traditional methods taught in skill classes, I did poorly).

My undergraduate studies are over and I feel that my grades are not reflective of my abilities.

I want to show graduate schools that I deserved to be in their programs, but they will surely scoff at my GPA.

Obviously, I can't have a do-over, so what can I do?",2018-12-07 06:29:34

"Entry-level job asking for 5+ professional references that I don't have, what should I do?",80,afzhku,"I recently interviewed for a Medical Office Associate job (the person who checks you in and out when you go to a doctor's office) at a local hospital and the next day I received a generic email from HR via Checkster asking for 5+ professional references (supervisors or peers, no family or friend's) as part of the hiring process. I clicked on the link and it said that I had been short-listed for the position and they needed to do a reference check as the next step and gave me 2 days to complete it. 

This step in the process wasn't mentioned in the application or the interview, so I was not prepared for it at all. I am not in contact with previous supervisors or coworkers, nor did my previous positions involve any sort of email correspondence, so I wouldn't be able to provide an email address if I had the references.

"Hiring managers and HR pros, how do you make salary, raise, and promotion decisions? What should I enforce as a manage and what should I expect as an employee?",81,a72vz1,"Hey all, let's talk salary. I have a few questions about how different companies set salaries and give raises and promotions. I'm keeping this as brief as possible, but am happy to add more color if needed.

1) Hiring Managers: how would you characterize your salary setting philosophy? Meaning, how much weight to you place on a new hire's individual skills & strengths vs their ""paper"" resume (their degree, their industry experience etc). Also, does this change when related to internal candidates where the candidate may have a great track record within the company and very concrete proven skills demonstrated during their employment thus far, but a weaker paper resume and less industry experience? 

2) Salary increases: I'll give an example here. I had two hires for the same position. I hired one in at a higher salary rate due to prior experience and a very strong resume, but the 2nd (more entry level in the industry, originally hired at a lower rate) is fantastic and quickly outpaced the more experienced hire.  Over 1+ year this employee has proven to be more productive, self driven and innovative, and has also taken on a bigger workload. I want to increase this 2nd hire's salary to be more comparable to the more experienced employee, but am getting pushback because this more entry level employee still technically has less experience. Is this normal? Or, as the hiring manager for this position, should I be pushing harder for a raise for this employee? Assume budget isn't a limiting factor here. 

3) Internal Promotions: I've seen my current company manage internal promotions in two different ways,  and I'm curious which is more common practice (or if both are used commonly, or something else)

Lets say a current employee proves their skills & worth and is clearly ready for a promotion. There is a larger role needed,  and the employee is a good fit for growth. Assume budget isn't the issue here, just employee development. Do you....

A) Offer the employee the additional responsibilities and a title change, as well as a salary bump.

B) Give the employee the additional responsibilities. If they do well, offer them the title change and salary bump after they prove they can do the new job. 

C) Another option? Post the new job and do a formal hiring process? Anything else? 

Tldr: paper resume or proven skills, which has more impact on an employee's salary? ",2018-12-17 21:17:28
What do I do if my boss offers me a new position with no raise but says that I'd be forced to resign if I refuse?,83,a69yyj,"Backstory:

I've been with this non profit organization for the last 2 years. I started as an Office Assistant but took on more duties that involved help in the administrative team. My duties evolved to the point that they decided to create a new title for me: Operations Specialist. This involves, IT support, systems management, Contact Resource Management, training new-hires, new hire paperwork, creating flyers and promotional materials for events, direct supervision of office assistant, compiling and reporting on data to our funders and contractors etc.

Today:

I was told this morning that they are going to move our current Office Manager to a different position and have me absorb her duties and her title. This means that, in addition to (most of) my current duties, I will be doing payroll, assisting in human resources, accounts payable, direct support for management, overseeing office supply inventory, answering all incoming phone calls, overseeing our incoming and outgoing mail, responding to our info@ emails, and be the contact person for all office staff for sick days and time off requests.

I asked what the new pay was going to be. I was told that I am already in the middle range of the new position so she wouldn't consider a pay raise discussion until 3 months. I asked if she would be flexible on that at all and was told that it's not in the budget at the moment and, because I will have to learn quickbooks, I don't have all of the job skills required yet anyway.

I asked what would happen if I decide the new position is not for me. I was told "" If you decided that it wasn't for you then I guess you are resigning.  We don't have any other positions open. ""

I have two questions: Can I get unemployment if I don't want the job? Have they done something wrong to me? I can't really figure it out. All I know is that I feel really hurt and don't feel like working here any more but can't seem to work out what specifically is making me feel that way. Any perspective you can provide would be most welcome. Thanks.

I'm 24 years old and make less than 20K per year. How can I get myself on a career path?,78,8xj4a3,"I originally posted this in offmychest and am now letting it rip here!

Hi, I'm ranting on the internet to unleash my panic and frustration and to perhaps receive some advice from peeps who may have similar experiences. Here is my long rant:

I'm a 24 year old female living in a major city and feeling like I'm wasting my time and potential on little piddly, low-paying ""jobs"" that by no means amount to a career. BUT, at the same time, I kind of like these little piddly, low-paying jobs because they are EXTREMELY low-pressure, low hours, and I actually like the work I'm doing.

I worked in an office once before and was absolutely MISERABLE. The corporate world IS NOT FOR ME. And I do not want to force myself to be a part of it when there MUST BE other ways of making strong earnings.

I am just able to cover my living expenses on my earnings and I am starting to panic that I am 24 years old and I have no savings. In the future, I want to be able to purchase a home, have capital to start my own business, and retire some day. I just can't seem to get myself on an upward path.

To be specific, I have 3 part-time jobs that amount to approximately 30 hours per week, but my schedule is often subject to cancellations based on my bosses' personal lives.

First job: I run a resell eBay store that an older woman in my community started but can no longer maintain. I run every aspect of the store: sourcing items, photographing the items, creating the listings, customer service, and shipping.

Second job: I am the photographer/videographer for a local clothing designer. I also help her with social media and various technology tasks.

Third job: I designed and now run an online store for ANOTHER clothing designer. I created the website, designed the online store, photograph, measure, and describe all products, create the listings, manage social media, and do all shipping.

Each of these jobs pay me $15 per hour.

I feel like I have no idea what I want to do in life, but I know that I have always LOVED clothes. Even as a quiet person, I have somehow become known in my (large) city for my personal style, which gives me a little bit of confidence in thinking that perhaps I should let my love for clothing guide my career path. I would love to open my own brick and mortar store, but understand that is a tough gig. I would also be happy owning an online store.

Do you have any suggestions that may help me strengthen my earnings and launch myself into a real career?

**TLDR: I like the work I'm doing but it doesn't make me much money and I feel like I am stuck in a low-paying rut.**

**EDIT:** Thank you all for the great responses. For a little added context, I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and graduated Summa Cum Laude, if that means anything. Though it was not my major, I completed an entire ""fieldwork"" semester that focused on public relations, communications, and marketing. (At the time, I concluded that  it was sleazy work!)

**EDIT:** THANK YOU again for this encouragement and feedback. I am really feeling hopeful and motivated to keep going in this direction!",2018-07-10 04:23:24
Best ways to improve public speaking/reduce social anxiety before beginning a job?,77,as2xkl,"I'm a very type B person. I think my interpersonal skills when one on one or in a small group are ok, but I am deathly terrified of public speaking, or even speaking up in a medium sized meeting. Anytime I have to give a presentation, introduce myself publicly in front of a large group of people, or something similar, my heart begins to race and I have a panic attack where I'm short of breath and my voice is shaky. It's embarrassing because I don't have any mental anxiety about these situations, but its entirely physical and I have no control over it. It's like muscle memory.

&#x200B;

I have had a prescription for beta blockers which have been an absolute miracle and basically gotten rid of any anxiety symptoms when in these situations. I will still use them during major presentations, but I don't want to feel reliant on them, and would prefer to go through some sort or training that can rewire my brain into not becoming stressed in these situations. I'm about to graduate college and begin a great job in a major city in which I will often have to give presentations to clients, and I will be surrounded by a lot of type A corporate individuals. 

&#x200B;

At this point it's absolutely essential that I get over this and am able to assimilate into my new job seamlessly. Would joining a Toastmasters club or Dale Carnegie help? I figure that practice is what will help me get over it, by teaching my brain to become less stressed in these situations. Unfortunately, I am unable to take a public speaking course at my university. I checked a local community college, but was confused if I was able to enroll not being a student, and if what I found was even a legitimate course. I believe this form of social anxiety I have is probably my biggest weakness and a major barrier that once its overcome, will allow me to thrive professionally.

Any advice, tips, or similar experiences that can be shared would be appreciated. I begin my new job this summer, and I feel like the longer I go without fixing this, the harder it will be to do so.",2019-02-19 00:25:27

Why am I expected to sit and do nothing all day?,80,8qhuzg,"I'm on my 3rd corporate job and I make a lot of money as a statistical programmer in finance. I have about $100k in student loans that I am already aggressively paying down, but getting to a net worth of $0 is going to take about 3 years. 

In every job I've had (1 consulting, 2 finance), I probably have 1-2 hours of real work to do each day but I am expected to keep the chair warm from 9 to 6. My team doesn't work in the same city as me, so I don't really understand why I need to be in the office. I've tried to create my own projects in every job, but (1) we are a regulatory function and there isn't much to add; and (2) I'm there to complete work that needs done, not dream up time-wasting projects to look busy with. 

The people in my office are on other teams so we don't have anything to talk about. They are also in very different life stages than me. We say hi but that's about it.

The usual advice in this situation seems to be ""use that free time to study for your next job."" Well I have been studying for the past 3 years post-grad, and that's exactly how I got this job. It's just going to get me into a different variant of this situation. Let me know which jobs don't require 9-6 desk sitting for statistical modelers and I'll definitely start studying.

I don't want to sit at a desk doing nothing all day. It's pointless, unhealthy, and rather lonely. My reviews are positive as when there is work, I do it quickly and with good quality. There just isn't enough work. 

This results in me trying to look busy all day when I'm really staring into space. I don't want another job in my field because they are all the like this (I'm on my 3rd one now) and I don't want to switch fields because I'd likely end up in the same situation for a lot less pay. 

**I want to work but there doesn't seem to be any worthwhile work to be done.** I am a bored, soulless desk sitter waiting for 6.

In my 3 years working as a designer I have grown to find the work unrewarding, meaningless, and not stimulating. Gradually my dissatisfaction with my career has lead me into an existential crisis and depression.

I have decided that I no longer want a desk/ office job that requires you to work on the computer majority of the day as I find it is not stimulating for me. I hate sitting in the same office behind a screen every day.

I want to find a non-desk job that is meaningful and rewarding. Something that I can be passionate about and feel good for contributing to the greater good of the world. Something that has good career trajectory - good potential to progress in my career and earn more as I get older. I would love to be working outdoors some of the time or at least moving around, not sitting at a desk.

I am particularly interested in the idea of doing environmental work of some sort - maybe forestry or wildlife conservation. I would also consider humanitarian or even social work.

I have a Bachelor of Design and would be willing to do further studies for up to 2 years to make me qualified for my dream job, whatever it may be.

The hard part is that I have not done maths or science further than junior high school so I can’t get into a Masters Degree that has prerequisites of maths and science.

I have considered carpentry and other trades, but I think I want to find something more meaningful that is having a positive impact rather than just just building houses or commercial buildings. Although, I think I would like to be working with my hands or doing technical work of some sort.

I have also considered fireman and paramedic jobs but I don’t think I would cope well with the stress and traumatic situations they have to deal with.

I have been looking for quite a while at possible career options or further studies but I am really stumped for answers. 

I struggle with anxiety and I am getting quite overwhelmed when searching and not seeming to make much progress so that is why thought I would try posting here to see what suggestions people have.

Does anyone out there have any ideas of cool jobs that I could look into or further studies that I could do to help me in the right direction?

Or has anyone gone through a similar experience with wanting a complete career change, to ditch their desk job and find something more fulfilling?

&#x200B;

If you have any suggestions at all, please throw them down. I just want to get as many ideas as possible.  


Thanks :)",2018-11-18 11:17:04

"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?",75,binfaf,"I work for a large engineering firm in the UK.

The company has a culture whereby effective, valuable and worthy candidates for promotion can spend months - or even years - operating at the level of the grade above, but simultaneously being denied a promotion.

The usual outcome to this is that the employee in question gets fed up and either moves role internally or leaves the business, after which the company invariably re-advertises their position **at the higher grade anyway**.

I have been with the company for 8 years now and have seen this happen time and time and time again. 

The obvious explanation is that the personnel asking for promotion are effectively ""dead wood"", and the managers are happy to see the back of them, or that they feel it is an opportunity to bring in outside talent. However, this is not the case. The ones being pushed to leave are often the hardest working and most ambitious, and usually have very niche and specialised knowledge/experience. The ""dead wood"", by comparison, seem to know they are on to a good thing and try not to rock the boat.

Is this common practice in other businesses? What is the justification behind this kind of approach to personnel management?",2019-04-29 12:20:14

I didn't pass probation for my dream job. How should i reflect on this?,77,a88zdq,"Hi all,

I didn't pass probation. It was an economist position. I'm new to the workforce, been working since graduation for ~11 months.

I feel some of it was my fault, but some of it was not. I did my best, and thought i was doing well. I could do things that others there couldn't do. I met deadlines (where they were given to me). I learnt R on the job, and in a month i could write complex geospatial analyses in R to help with evidence-building to work out effective consumer choice.

But around 3 months into the job it looks like (and only on the last day did i realise) management was assembling evidence to boot me out. A report was drafted and the managers agreed i should not pass probation.

Comments made to me were:

* Couldn't get a piece of R  work done on time (the code was done by another team member and malfunctioning. Worse still, another team member left it half done and didn't touch it for a month. I was effectively blamed for that.)
* Didn't understand a concept around a productivity measure (i did, but the data i relied on another organisation to give it to me was never there - so i tried alternative measures which didn't make sense)
* Inability to let things go (true - i kept thinking someone had a problem with me so i made sure i didn't do something wrong by accident)
* Asked too many questions (could have told me to stop, and would have)
* Attention to detail lacking sometimes (in the cases they raised, they said it was ""fine""...ugh)

Some things said of me wasn't really true, so i think a part of it was that i didn't click with the team (esp. the managers).

But i don't care about blaming people. I care about making sure this never happens again. How do i reflect on this?

I have interviews lined up, and i'm actually in close contention for one position (they didn't get this employer's reference and accepted the reason i gave - which technically is not a lie). 

How can i be sure if i get a similar position, i don't fuck it up? I can't bear giving up on an economist career (at least for a while) after this failure, but is being an economist even right for me?

Help me reflect on this.

"I’m a 29 yo flight attendant. If you were in my shoes, would you tough it out and keep flying until you can retire or start over? What else would you transition into?",76,a06016,"Growing up I was a typical straight A student/cheerleader/overachiever who never really put much thought into what I wanted to be when I grew up. I did what everyone else was doing and went to college where I gained a bachelors of science with a 3.5 gpa. I initially thought I wanted to go to pharmacy school but changed my mind after finishing the prerequisites & working a couple years as a full time pharmacy technician. At that age I wasn’t motivated by money (I am now) and felt like I would be bored to death performing quality control on medications everyday. Soooo it was a NO for me. Instead of quitting altogether, 3 years in, I made the decision to at least finish what I’d started and spend my 4th year putting my credits towards a biology degree. (Full disclosure, Low scores on the PCAT exam & HIGH stress levels trying to study and balance life played a role in this choice...) Fast forward to today, I cannot see myself going back to school to do anything else in the healthcare industry. Just watching shows like greys anatomy or botched and the thought of more student loans make me VERY nauseous. 


Prior to college and since graduating, I’ve had various roles in hospitality/customer service: cooking, hosting, catering, serving, bottle service/bartending, etc and have been lucky enough to keep a position as a flight attendant for the past 6 years. 
In the beginning, it was GREAT! I traveled the world and never really saw it as “work” but for the past almost 3 years, that’s changed drastically & I’ve had a daily internal struggle over what else I can do with my life. The actual job itself is EASY but the lack of sleep = constant jet lag, living out of a suitcase, time alone/away from loved ones, and just having to be personable all the time is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m depressed and I know it’s because of my current lifestyle. I used to just enjoy my time alone at home on days off but I’ve become such an introvert that I barely want to leave the house/hotel rooms or talk to anyone now at all unless I HAVE to. Im never rude to passengers and have a perfect attendance record, but when I work with so many bubbly personalities and see people who genuinely want to go above and beyond inflight, it just confirms even more that this role isn’t for me anymore. I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and care more about consistency, stability, & work/life balance or just bored with life in general and need to stick with something that will stimulate my mind. I wish I had some sort of passion I could be pursuing in my down time, but I don’t. I thought about teaching and became a substitute for a year but couldn’t see it as a long term career either. I’m afraid I have already become complacent like many of my colleagues who’ve been flying an average of 20-40 years yet have the same complaints I do. With everything being seniority based, they say things get better with time but I’m not convinced. Also I barely use my flight benefits so they aren’t a factor keeping me “stuck” 


I STAY on indeed & the career section of so many companies & apply for jobs constantly but I’m also constantly rejected for positions I’m qualified to do (flight attendant supervisor, recruiter, instructor, anything hotel related etc) and I don’t have the experience or education required for anything outside this field paying a decent salary ($60k +). My degree is pretty much useless other than the fact that it shows I’m “smart” but clearly not smart enough to figure out a better life path. Anyone I’ve ever confided in has said “you’ll figure it out eventually” but like I said, it’s been years and I still haven’t found my calling. I’m grateful for the paycheck/benefits and understand that many ppl do not ENJOY their jobs but my job has become my entire life and I’m no longer enjoying much of it at all. ",2018-11-25 07:32:55

How do you carefully explain to recruiters that you needed to take a break after your last job without creating any suspicions about your character and capability?,76,9fgeu0,"I don’t plan on telling future recruiters how terrible my past job was even if there is a chance they might have heard about it (yes, the company is that notorious). I know enough to never bring that topic up in interviews and to just leave it all behind the past. But how do I carefully explain that I needed to take a break and a possible two month gap of unemployment? 

The truth is, my job burned me out and was becoming unhealthy for me physically and emotionally. Almost every day I have to worry about colleagues that might try to sabotage me, I work with people that do not care about properly guiding you through a process you aren’t familiar with and I’m constantly bothered with the realization that this job wasn’t for me in the first place. I stuck around just long enough to have my evaluation, which was fortunately positive and then decided I have done enough. 

I might have depression, I’m seeing a professional for this and for any possible treatment. I don’t want to bring any of this baggage to my next job so I’m doing everything I can to become healthy again. 

How are you supposed to spend your break when you’re trying to heal from extreme burn out and sudden loss of confidence? And what other way is there to carefully explain to future employers that you needed a break without sounding like someone who couldn’t handle the pressures of corporate life? ",2018-09-13 12:09:36

Just got a job at a new company and no one here is doing their jobs. What do I do about it?,73,bbnpf2,"I took this job after intensely talking to just about everyone Id be working with.  Its a smaller company and I knew they had growing pains, but holy fuck.  The management here is just completely apathetic.  I'm extraordinarily ambitious and a fast worker and cant even get a straight answer from my manager as to what I am supposed to be doing.  These people are completely clueless.  99% of their endeavors are failures.  Not because of technical feasibility, but because of incompetence.  They got lucky once after 20 years of trying and that happened to be worth $20 million a year.

My first instinct is to bail for another job.  But honestly I am sick of doing that.  I make a lot of money here and don't really want to find a new job.  I'd much rather start making positive contributions to the culture and work product here, but I feel like I just cant.  Like I have zero support from management and am just handcuffed to mediocrity.  I have already whipped one project into shape and the only reason we are meeting our deadline is because of me, but I was rewarded with zero recognition and being taken off the project as soon as it was successful.

"27, associates degree and stuck in a dead-end job. No real passion or direction, but a strong desire to better my life. Where do I even start?",72,8mv5yw,"I'm 27, married and have an associates degree from a good community college. For the last few years i've been working as a medical assistant at a family owned place. The pay isn't great, I get no benefits and there's no room for advancement. The work is fine, though it's not something I particularly enjoy or anything.

I need to find a better job; one with better pay and benefits. I want to start improving me and my wife's life, and getting a career seems like the first step. The problem is I have no clear passions or a sense of what direction i'd like to move in. My life-track has kind of been just the default for a while without me really making many decisions. Go to high school -> go to community college till you figure out what you want to do -> get a job until you figure out which bachelors degree you want -> still stuck here.

I'm a pretty hard worker with pretty average intelligence. The closest thing I have to a passion is computers, though i'm not sure i'm cut out for computer science/programming. I don't know what I want to do, and the fact that i'm already 27 without a clear path forward scares me. I'm afraid of wasting even more time and want to work towards something but I can't figure out what, and don't know how to even begin figuring it out.

I switched majors 3 times. I am about to switch again. Is this a good idea or am I being insane?,74,au35nw,"Hey, this story turned out pretty long so thanks in advance for reading it. 

Alright so most subjects in school didn't really interest me. I only liked Dutch, English and art. Unsurprisingly, my grades were quite bad. Luckily they were good enough to pass. 
After my graduation I had no idea what to study so I took a gap year and started working at Burger King (very impressive, I know). After a year I decided I wanted to study social work. Well that didn't work out for someone with social anxiety like me. I also didn't really enjoy the classes. After quitting I went back to working at the lovely burger heaven. I couldn't really stand that for much longer, so I started studying again. I picked goldsmithing for this. Yes, that made sense to me. See, I've always loved drawing and painting so I figured I'd do something creative. But I didn't enjoy the sawing, soldering and all the other technical aspects of the subject. After quitting I started working at a factory to ""save up"". Note: I used to spend my money like you would spend the toilet paper after eating an extra spicy burrito. At this point I went through a couple of miserable months. I eventually ended up at the airport with only 100 euros, about to go to Madrid. If it wasn't for my ex who stopped me, I would probably still be bathing in some Spanish ditch right now. Anyway, after this fiasco my friend suggested I should go for a course that allows me to only attend school once a week, while working the other 4 days. This seemed perfect for me since I would be able to achieve a certificate by experiental learning. The only subject that offers this kind of education here is cooking so I went with it. Bad decision once again, because man... I am way too dreamy and inattentive for this kind of job. It's also very exhausting and I get no free time anymore. So now, at the age of 20, I'm considering quitting again and starting a graphic design course, because I truly love design and I can seriously stare at a computer screen for lifetimes, trying to create a perfect photograph or logo. I also have a great passion for photography, but a lot of people can't really earn a living with that so I go for graphic design. I am really unsure about this though, because I'm afraid I will dislike this as well. Is quitting again a good idea, or will this just cause me to become used to giving up, rather than fighting? If I go for a new start, how could I get myself to make it work this time? Also, would it be a good idea to study the subject abroad?

Thanks again for reading this long ass post and here's an imaginary potato. :) ",2019-02-24 04:15:17
How do I get employers/people to stop pigeon-holing me into a career I no longer want?,72,aprh94,"I’m a former behavior therapist/BCBA supervisee and current LPC-Intern in the state of Texas. I no longer wish to become an LPC or BCBA for a variety of reasons. 

I have prior experience working in research (three years experience in an experimental psychology lab working with rats and one year working in a health psychology lab). So as a way to exit out of my former therapy career, and possibly explore other careers that’s less psychotherapy/social services-related and more on the medical and/or research sides, I have been applying like crazy to various Research Assistant positions in the Texas Medical Center.  

The issue I keep running into, besides the various comments I keep receiving about how I shouldn’t be unemployed because: “mental health professionals are in-demand!we need mental health professionals!! (lol), is that a ton of people are skeptical about why someone with a master’s in clinical psychology would be interested in working in a lab, especially someone with an LPC-Intern license. (Also, lots of ABA providers and counseling centers have been confused, at best, about my prior research/lab experience, but I digress). The truth is that what I studied turned out to be a terrible fit. I’m looking for a way to move on with my life, be able to pay my bills, and eventually study something else that’s actually going to result in a viable career. So far, the only other significant work experience I have besides therapy/social services, ABA programs/centers, and a bunch of various other customer service jobs is working as a research assistant. How do I get people to stop pigeon-holing me back into a therapy career I no longer want, and be marketable as a research assistant or something else where my skills are transferable (and maybe also be in an environment where I can learn more in-demand skills)?

TL;DR: Originally was training  to be a therapist (LPC) and behavior analyst (BCBA). I no longer want these things. Based on my prior work history, I think my best chance at a job outside of anything therapy or ABA-related is to find a position as a research assistant while I figure out the rest of my life and possibly explore other medical and/or research careers that may be a better fit for me.

How to deal with aggressive know-it-all co-worker?,76,aj5il8,"What does it mean if coworker's first response to something they don't understand is ALWAYS ""this is wrong""?   And let's just say that there's a lot that he doesn't understand.

I've also never had a conversation that he didn't aggressively brag during.  Whatever the topic he relays it back to his resume, ""years of experience,"" and ""degree in X."". Fine things to say for a job interview, but he was hired over a year ago and still talks about his resume every conversation.  His skills do look better on the resume than in real life.  

He'll say things that are objectively wrong, but sound technical so no one but me understands that it's b.s.  

He's very protective of his work and hiding it from the review/QA of others.  But he also sticks his nose in other people's work, micromanages his reports, and tries to micromanage people who aren't his reports.

My stay-at-home mom of 20 yrs wants to start career - which path (nurse or teacher)?,71,a5y78f,"Hi all, hope this is an appropriate sub for this.

My mom wants to go back to school - she is 42, she's been a stay at home mom/housewife for over 20 years. No college degree. She's likely divorcing my dad in a few years...and will need to have a career/income/life of her own.

I'm hand-holding her through this whole process because she's overwhelmed and of course I'd do anything to get her where she needs to be. We're torn between two career paths for her - teacher or nurse.

The way I see it, teacher = 4 yr degree, testing, then employment at an elementary school - she loves children, the hours are pretty nice, summers off, decent benefits. Yeah, teacher salaries are pretty low, but she'd only be supporting herself. I'm a substitute teacher and I think it is so rewarding and fun and I know she'd be great at it, she agrees.

Nursing is something she's been vaguely interested in for a while, and she could get an Associate's in nursing, start working, and work on her Bachelor's while she does so. The money is about the same between teacher and ADN, but better if she has a BSN. Other than that idk much else about nursing. Personally I wouldn't like working in a hospital poking people with needles but she thinks she would love to work maybe in midwifery/maternal/neonatal care.

I am trying the best I can to lay out a very detailed timeline of what EXACTLY she needs to do to pursue either of these, starting with testing, pre-reqs, admission to a degree program, and everything leading up to employment, and the lifestyle with it.

"Happy workers of reddit, how did you find your calling?",71,91w7n1,"Howdy, I don’t really post on here to often. I was just wondering how some of you folks that are actually happy with your careers discovered it. Feeling lost in the world as I’m 29 and still don’t know what I wanna be when I grow up. I’ve worked a decent variety of jobs over the years but have yet to find anything I actually enjoy getting out of bed and doing, let alone dedicating my life too. For a back story, here’s some things I’ve done and decided it wasn’t for me after doing it for a time. 

Rave DJ - ended up parting and getting wasted to much to not die before I hit 30. Not a productive lifestyle when your 19.

Army medic - I was good at it but wasn’t full bought in on the military life style. After 10 months of sitting on a random base in Kuwait   during deployment decided not to re-enlist.

Asbestos and mold testing field tech - ok income but the job got super boring after a year and a half. Also decided that my income was pretty much as high as I was gonna make without a degree.

Golf Coarse Manager - it’s a chill college job but no interest in doing this long term. I also hate golf after dealing with golfers all day.

Currently going to school for criminal justice on GI bill but the program is to easy and feel like I’m just using the degree to try to get into a better masters program. Not as interested in becoming a police officer as I was 2 years ago. Can’t really change majors without paying for classes on GI bill so finishing it out. 

Anyways, feel like I’m being more proactive than just sitting around but still yet to find something that I actually enjoy. Hoping for some tips from people to find something that is actually meaningful and will pay the bills. I don’t feel like I’m lazy or anything but I’ve never worked a job I actually enjoyed. I was thinking emergency management or fire department but it’s hyper competitive where I am. My fiancé has a pretty good job where I am so wouldn’t wanna move on a gamble that I might like it more.

Company went ghosting on me after job offer. Tomorrow is the “start date”. What should I do?,72,910r8n,"Hello, 

I’m just writing because I find myself in a really weird situation. A month ago I interview at the BBC for a really good job  (35k£ entry level) 

After a week I receive a phone call from one of the recruiters saying I had gotten the job and she would later send me all the information via e-mail. During the phone call she did say who my manager would be as well as the starting date.

After that nothing.


It has been two weeks now and I have kept chasing this recruiter for an official letter/confirmation but I got nothing. A couple of days ago I have also called the main office and was told by a Manager that he would make sure the material got to me by the end of the day but I got nothing from that too.

Tomorrow is the day I am supposed to start (at least based on what the recruiter said).

What should I do? 

At the moment the only idea is to show up at the reception and see what happens because I don’t know what to think anymore.

Don’t know if any of you had ever been in a similar situation. 

UPDATE:

Showed up at the office today and they were expecting me. Induction day today. Thanks everyone!",2018-07-22 23:27:46
"*Update* Fresh out of college, and one month into my job at a startup, I got an offer from a big company with a 35% jump in pay. Should I be giving any thought to staying?",75,8oobz2,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8o30ks/fresh_out_of_college_and_one_month_into_my_job_at/

Hopefully this sub doesn't mind an update. I had a difficult decision, appreciated all of the feedback I got, and I wanted to give some closure to the story and get feedback.

Ultimately I erred on the high risk, high reward side and was hoping for a high counter offer to make this an easier decision. Today I got offered $60,000 plus a 5% bonus which narrowed an ~$18,000 gap to a $7,000 gap. 

I settled for 3 weeks PTO instead of 4. I also passed up a 6% 401K match for no 401K plan, however the other company has poor healthcare options while my current employer pays for a zero deductible plan outright, so I'll call that a wash. 

I can't say I'm not nervous about the decision, but the extra $100 in each paycheck wasn't compelling enough to make me leave a small, high growth company for a large company with little to no growth. I like my manager, the executive leadership, and I'm hoping this will provide me with a better opportunity to take on more responsibility. 

Anyhow, thanks for all of the feedback. I'm going to ride the wave and time will tell if this was the right call (assuming I don't get kicked to the road in 6 weeks for a cheaper option lol). Feedback about my decision is definitely welcome!",2018-06-05 08:36:14
What to do after getting complaints with no specific examples after a year of working super hard?,73,b1g4vc,"Hey guys
I work in IT and I've been working here almost a year. I've busted my butt I've worked super hard and I've learned a lot at this job. I've been super overworked and I've told the higher ups that there's a lot on my plate every day.

Yesterday I got called into the boss's office with my manager. They told me that they're not happy with me and that I've gotten many complaints about doing a bad job and how they've had a conversation with HR about my lack of efficiency. I've apparently made mistakes (none that have been relayed back to me and none that I can even recall). They flat out told me that if i don't improve they have to get rid of me. Also they told me they're hiring someone to help me out which also makes no sense. When I asked for them to give me specific examples they shrugged it off saying ""there isn't one that we can give off the top of our heads"". I asked if there's some kind of proof of me messing something up or not being efficient and they again said they couldn't give me a specific case. This came out of nowhere to me because I've done nothing but work hard here. They then shortly after apologized for being too harsh and aggressive. It's been a year and clearly I'm starting fresh on gaining trust and making a good impression. What should I do now in this scenario?

I think I fucked up the last 24 years of my life. Should I go back to get another degree?,76,9vytlm,"I thought I always had everything in the bag. Graduate, go to law school, and then live an okay life. But as I worked an internship at a law office and was unable to take the LSAT this year (law school admission test) due to family reasons, I’m beginning to realise more and more that this may not be what I wanted.

Unfortunately, all the jobs I’ve been able to find with my useless BA degrees (Criminology/Film, God knows why) are in sales and marketing and that is definitely something I do not want to do for the rest of my life. It never actually occurred to me to try my hand at anything STEM related, but I’m beginning to think I should go back to school to get a BS instead. I literally have nothing else gunning for me except for some job experience (peer academic counselor) and good grades. It’s kind of depressing. I also have some stupid dream to work in the game industry someday and I’m nowhere near that at all.

How do you know if you're happy with a job? Is the grass greener on the other side?,73,aleg44,"I have a well paid job for the LCOL area I'm in, and I like living here. My job is overall pretty comfortable with a ton of autonomy (maybe too much) and I pretty much have my systems in place. Some days I feel like I could make a good living by working here forever. Other days, there are some people I have to work with who I really don't like and they bum me out. 

How do I know when I'm happy? The alternative I face is to move out of the area for a job aligned with my skills in a more populated area. Or, I could stay where I am and find a job I could do and take a pay cut.

"Wife is stuck in a career hole, what can I do to help?",73,bmt162,"5 years ago my wife graduated with psychology degree and planned to go to occupational therapy school to become an occupational therapist. Upon graduating, she applied to a school close to the city we live in, and did not make it in. This was apparently normal for this school, and a few people she knew that had been accepted told her to get some part-time experience in the field, and apply again the next year. This is exactly what she did and the second go round she got all the way to a second interview and crushed it. Thought for sure she had it this time, but, no. They told her the average gpa in that application year was the highest in history and they strictly stick to the higher pool. They spoke so highly of her, and begged her to apply again the following year. 

Well life happened, and bills need to be paid, so she really needed to land a decent paying job. She applied for a certain rental car company position and got it. Pay is decent, benefits and vacation are killer, but the hours and work atmosphere have taken a beating on her. Truthfully, she has hit the point where she hates her job. She will randomly apply to other jobs, and has received many offers, but the pay/benefits are exceptionally bad in comparison to her current job. She wants out bad enough that a pay hit is ok, but the offers received have been laughably bad. This really kills her motivation to keep pushing, and I truly don’t know what to do to help. I’ve told her to just quit to clear her mind and relax and it’ll happen, but she won’t do it. I constantly search for job openings in hope I can find something good, but she normally shoots down the ones I find. 

I have a good career and have been excelling and it partly makes me feel guilty how it’s worked out for me. I want her to have the feeling of self worth in her job that I know she yearns for, but I don’t know how to give it to her. She’s the love of my life, and I want nothing more than to see her happy. Her current day to day has really beaten her down. I really want to help her, but I can’t seem to find the right angle on it or what exactly I can even do to truly help her. 

I’m seeking guidance on what I can do to help without pushing her too much.  Good career options with her current degree are hard to come by and openings are few and far between. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

I've (23F) graduated with BA in psychology May 2017 and have been working in clinical research since. While humanities will always have my heart I don't feel like I'm getting the mental stimulation that I crave. I don't want to go into counseling or clinical work which basically makes me degree worthless. In school my professors constantly urged me to get into STEM/Bio-Med because of my strong analytical skills with research methods and stats.

Tell me about the degree's you've obtained and where you're working now.

They have a Masters Degree in Chemistry, but that certification won't directly transfer over.

25 year old female, introverted. 2yrs work experience in an office, admin work.

Preferred job types:

* ""Technician"" type of jobs that can take advantage of a scientific background
* Like working with people
* This is an example 1-year program that works: Food Quality Assurance Technician[https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/food-safety-and-quality-assurance-food-processing](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/food-safety-and-quality-assurance-food-processing)
* Ultrasound / Pharmacy /Blood Technician / Dental Hygienist / Massage Therapist would be great but they all **require 2+years of school** which is too much time/money.
* Something like bartending would be good, but it isn't a legitimate 1 year college program so you cant get a study permit for it

Open to many ideas as there are always so many jobs out there that we never think of!

Non-preferred Job types:

* Not coding
* Not manual labour (no construction, roofing, garbageman, oil rig, auto garage etc.)
* No citizenship / drivers license required (not military, not air hostess, not bus/truck driver)
* Must cost $15000 or less in tuition... this is many years worth of savings in foreign currency

My mom and stepdad (early fifties) are poor and unskilled—what can they do to make more money?,72,bsoxe2,"Hello,

I'm not asking for advice for myself but rather my mom and stepdad, who are in their early fifties. They're both immigrants from Vietnam. My mom came here about 25 years ago. She's currently a citizen and can speak enough English to communicate but not understand grammar or more technical things. She does nails at a nail shop owned by her friend, but business is extremely slow. My stepfather came here just two years ago. He doesn't speak English and currently works for minimum wage at a Chinese restaurant. They make under $30,000 a year combined.

What should they do at their age and skill level to make more money and improve their lives? My mom could make a lot more money if she worked at another nail shop, but she doesn't want to do anything besides manicures and pedicures because doing fake nails requires use of harmful chemicals, although it makes more money. I think she's counting on my uncle, her brother, to help her buy her own nail shop. He's an occupational therapist and makes decent money, but there's no guarantee he'll help her. Also, he's out of work at the moment.

My stepdad seems to have settled in to his minimum wage restaurant job. He has a license to do nails, but he doesn't seem interested in it. He probably should have gone for a hair cutting license, but they decided against it for some reason.

I was thinking (although maybe it's not too realistic) that my mom could take English classes and then attend college to get a degree in something, like nursing. While she's not working, I could help her out a bit. Maybe my stepdad could do something similar. If not, though, what are some good options for them to make more money and increase their standard of living?",2019-05-25 04:20:57
What is the best way to handle a highly influential but difficult subordinate?,65,b44xq3,"I work part time lecturing at a small college.  I do it on the side because I really really enjoy it.  When I joined another professional joined and we have taught together over the last several semesters.  After the first semester I was asked to coordinate for the course, basically insure that all the sections were the same--i.e. students got the same content regardless of professor.  Both of us have very different styles, but in the end we teach the same material.

&#x200B;

Early on I recognized that our course needed updates, I worked with admin and got those updates implmented.  Needless to say, those changes have not been well received.  I solicited the other professor for feedback on numerous occasions without success, so in essence all changes were my changes.  Now with all of the new material, I get passive aggressive messages about when are we going to stop changing (with cc to multiple admin levels for the tiniest detail).  Also the individual has stopped communicating directly with me.

&#x200B;

Here's my conundrum--this person is a C-level executive at their normal job and I am basically a peon.  They bring a ton of prestige to the program, while I bring only my wit and excitement for teaching.  In addition to the above, there are several 'unprofessional' behaviors (nothing scandalous, this is academia, so just think 'rude') I have observed during conferences--this person is obviously aware of their import and like to remind everyone of it.

&#x200B;

How do I deal with this individual. What are some strategies to at least get this person in line with what we want to teach without undermining me at every step.  While I am technically 'in charge' of the course, I have no power to sit them down and say ""We need to address this behavior"" and every meeting I have ever scheduled has been blown off (even before any changes were made, we've always had a distant relationship)--in addition our teaching is remote.  My admin is sympathetic to my plight, but I know that the students sense the friction (he \[ed. sorry typo\] openly badmouth me in his classes, perhaps forgetting that everything is recorded, and me watching his videos is my way of making sure we are synched, while I release my notes/slides/videos to all sections) and our teaching has diverged to the point where he blew off the final I wrote, something I was very passionate about as it gave our students some real-world style experience.",2019-03-22 16:14:25

"I'm miserable at what I thought was my ""dream"" accounting job, does anyone have advice on finding a job I'm good at and enjoy?",67,a3p7gu,"I've been working at my current job as an accountant in shared services for almost a year now. I work for a pretty large company and my job mostly consists of month end close, reconciliations, balance sheet reviews, lots of entries, etc. I knew it would be hard adapting to ""real world"" accounting after I graduated last year, but I'm just not getting it and I'm on the verge of giving up.

I keep making silly careless mistakes because a lot of my month end close tasks are very technical and it confuses the shit out of me. 11 months in and I'm still asking my partner questions almost daily. I'm constantly making stupid mistakes like trying to reconcile a P&L entry to the balance sheet for example (did this yesterday). Or writing off large PO's by accident. I can tell that my partner is getting fed up with my silly mistakes and the feeling of underperforming at my job plus things outside of work are taking a toll on my mental health. I'm honestly trying so hard but I just can't seem to grasp a lot of the concepts. One of the biggest problems is that my department doesn't formally train new employees on the month end close process and you are expected to learn as you go. I'm the only person in my department straight out of university, and it is painfully obvious. My job is nothing like university accounting classes. Division accountants are starting to doubt me because of my silly mistakes, so I'm not given higher responsibilities like my coworkers. I left work early yesterday because I made several mistakes in one day, my partner started lecturing me like a child, and I had a breakdown in my office. And I don't even blame her, I'd be frustrated too.

It doesn't help that my partner is the perfect ""star"" accountant who gets everything right, and I feel like I'm being compared to her while she's up on a pedestal.

I haven't gotten any negative feedback during my last two performance evaluations, but I can't help but feel like this is not where I'm supposed to be. This was my dream company when I was in school, I got my dream job and it's made me miserable.

I don't think I'm ready to give up on accounting, but maybe I should try out a different role in accounting. I took a leap last night and applied for a cost analyst job at another company. I'm not sure what role in accounting I would enjoy, and I'm praying that I'm able to find something I'm good at.

Has anyone been in a similar position and has advice?",2018-12-06 18:01:33
"Headhunter got upset after I turned down job, revealed a signing bonus that was never mentioned. Is this common?",68,9nv9jr,"I am a remote contractor and was contacted by a headhunter with an opportunity at a local firm. I interviewed, they liked me, and made me a job offer. Offer good, but not good enough - about a $10k income drop plus a 30 minute commute and all the other unknowns that come with a new job.
Odd stuff occurred as well, hiring manager called me and said headhunter asked him to give me a call, “he didn’t really know why” and then said, “do you have specific questions on your offer?”
What offer?
Turns out they had sent an offer letter that day. So he gives me the verbal, and it is ok, but doesn’t make me giddy, and I say, “thanks, I’ll look it over.”
It’s Friday. Takes them a while to get me a benefit premium breakdown. Insurance costs lower, but numbers don’t add up, I still have a $10k deficit. I like working remotely, in an earlier time zone, in my PJs. So I call the hiring manager and tell him it is a soft no, and he says, “well if you change your mind we have a lot if hiring to do.”
Headhunter emails me saying, “what happened? I specifically told you to contact me if the numbers were off. We have a significant amount of money earmarked for this situation. I guess I’ll never understand.”
So three things struck me:
1) the assumption that it was the money (well, TBH I made the mistake(?) of telling them what I was making, so she knew there was a gap)
2) this “significant amount of money” was never mentioned until after the fact
3) the “I guess I’ll never understand” makes me think this same scenario has played out at least once (and probably several times) before.

I think I am going to stop using headhunters. In my last 2 interactions, I was harassed to disclose “the number I would take”. I guess I’ll never understand.",2018-10-13 19:58:04
My boss is asking me to do things outside of my job description. I'm afraid it's getting out of hand. How can I turn this around?,66,9l5w2j,"I recently started my first full time job out of undergrad. I'm a creative writer. That's what I'm qualified to do. That's what I know. The job is at a small law firm, and I was hired to run the blog, help draft damages letters, and so on. 

A few weeks ago, things were going well. I was writing regular blog content and spicing up things that needed to be sent to defendants or shown in court. It took a bit of a learning curve, but I was completely on top of it. 

Then my boss decided our website needed a redesign. I thought he'd outsource the design and have me write the site text. I showed him some other sites I thought were well designed and pointed out how design language could be used to engage potential clients. Suddenly I was in charge of the design. 

Right away, I told him that despite having some limited knowledge of good UX principles, I was not qualified to do an entire website. He told me that I'm ""smarter than I think."" 

Now I've been working on the site for a few weeks. I got him to let me use a pretty dumbed down website building tool so that it would look nice despite the fact that this isn't something I've done before. He keeps asking me to add in animations and build pages that a) this building tool doesn't allow for and b) that I wouldn't know how to create even if it did. 

Every time I present something to him, he wants something even more technically impressive. I keep coming just close enough to what he previously wanted for him to up the ante again. 

He also asked me to design an entire digital marketing strategy spanning multiple domains we own, and including ads etc.

I'll say it again. I am a writer. I write a lot, and I write well, but I am not a visual creative, nor a programmer, nor a web expert. At this point I'm barely doing any of the things I was initially hired to do. 

My boss isn't malicious. He is getting carried away, and doesn't listen to outside opinion. I've communicated my lack of knowledge every time he asks for something. I don't know what to do. How do I stop this train from derailing?

But after 8 hours straight of nothing but washing dirty dishes, getting wet, moving around heaps of clean dishes and pans and knifes, mopping the floor at the end of the day, cleaning everything, drying everything, just when you think you maybe have done the bulk of the dishes and can relax a bit thats when the clock turns 8 and a tsunami of customers come in and you realise the past agonising 5 hours were mere childs play. on many occasions i thought about just completely walking out and not looking back. On my break they gave me something to eat which was nice (if only i didn't have to eat it on the fire exit stairs because the lounge was full) when eating it i found my self with tears pouring down my face onto the plate. After my 20 minutes were up I got back to it, and when the day was over and everything was as good as new for the chefs in the morning I finally got to go home at midnight, straight to bed with aching muscles everywhere. When i woke up i find that i can't move my right wrist too well and have rashes on both arms. my next shift is in 3 hours and i'm so tempted to not show up, sure the job is ""easy"" as in easy to understand what to do and where things go, but fucking hard physical labour. I talked about it to my mum but she said i must not quit and that its always like that. I'm torn between the dread of everyone being disappointed in me and the dread of having to go back to it all for another 8 hours. whether i should care about my physical and mental health or care about if everyone sees me as a failure. what the hell do i do?",2018-07-29 14:25:42

"33, getting trapped in food service/retail?",65,ab8xky,"So I do have a degree, and several years ago I worked for a financial services firm. But they were lay offing people and I decided to do a coding boot camp, which lead to no job. Afterwards I worked in a restaurant for a few years.

It's been several years since then. I gave my resume to a recruiter and it sounds like I'm not getting call backs because there are too many resume gaps of ""real"" experience. I'm getting quite worried.

How do I negotiate salary when my responsibilities are doubling?,69,a7ddpv,"Double the work equals double the money, right? If only life were so simple.

I highlighted my design/marketing skills gained through my old advertising career to my boss, and he wants to make me the marketing point person for my branch while keeping all my current admin duties.

"Should I dump my current somewhat stressful job with better pay and rotating schedule for a 9-5 M-F, less stressful job with a $400/month pay cut?",69,a353oy,"I (25F) am a respiratory therapist at a huge hospital in South Carolina currently. I’ve been here for a year and a half (only RT job I’ve had). It’s primarily critical care and has a children’s side to. I work in both areas with a passion for pediatrics. The schedule is nice sometimes- 12 hour shifts but I only work 3 per week and off 4. But we’re required to work every other weekend. My boyfriend whom I live with and will soon be engaged/married to (within the next year or two) works 9-5 M-F. All weekends and holidays off. A lot of the weekends I work we want to do things together. Or go to things in th evenings but I don’t get off until 7. This isn’t a job I want to do forever but it pays decent. It’s very high stress and takes a toll on you emotionally. I see people take their last breaths regularly. It has a high burn out rate. 

A position opened up within my hospital group but it is an outpatient facility. It’s in their pediatric Pulmonology department. I would never work with critically ill, dying people. This is basically a regular doctors office but for strictly Pulmonology patients. It’s something I would LOVE to do. It’s 9-5 M-F. Boyfriend and I would share schedules. It’s a job I could see myself doing long term. I interview for it tomorrow. I may not even be offered it but if I am I need to be prepared with how to process it. The big kicker with this is I would take a $400/month pay cut. I have about $23,000 in student loan debt and about $12,000 in other debts. No mortgage or rent. I pay about $600 to loans monthly which is above minimum. All loans are 6% apr or lower. It’s a huge loss when I have so much debt I’m paying down. But it’s low stress, highly sought after, low burnout. People literally retire in this position. 

Do I suffer the pay cut and make it work? I can always pick up random Saturday shifts in critical care and make about $220 in one day. Those shifts may or may not always be available. But more than likely they will be. I could pick a Saturday, or a Sunday even, boyfriend and I have no plans and pick up money. That just puts me at working 6 days a week to make ends meet while I’m currently working 3. 

I’m just having a hard time weighing out the pros and cons. They’re about equal, but it’s basically finances vs mental well being. 

Edit: I feel it is safe to mention I DO like my current job. I have some great coworkers. It can be strenuous at times and mentally exhausting but very rewarding. If I absolutely hated it the decision wouldn’t be so hard. But I know I’d love this other position 10x more. And not come home mentally and physically exhausted everyday. 



Update:
The manager called me with an unofficial offer and do to some credentials I carried, it bumped my job code up and increased my starting pay to almost what I make now. It’s maybe 80c per hour different. However I will work 4 extra hours a week and end up breaking even. My decision was made for me! Low stress job, weekends off, same schedule as significant other, with the same pay!! 

Thanks for all your advice though. It did help tremendously. ",2018-12-04 23:28:38
How many of you actually got to your current job by sending out resumés to job openings?,70,7w75qw,"I've been out of work and sending out CVs for close to 6 months now. I've gotten absolutely no interviews, and only a couple of rejection notices. It's mostly radio silence.

I've watched a couple of job seeking lectures on Youtube, and these guys are telling us that spending time on your resumé and sending out CVs is a waste of time. However (obviously) to really find out what's the cool, hip way of finding a job, you have to sign up for their $99 lecture in which they'll teach us everything.

I suspect most of those only aim to prey at desperate unemployed people.

However, I'm at a loss here, as sending out resumés and applying to job openings on LinkedIn isn't bringing me anything.

I was excited for the new opportunity. The move is lateral in my company but it would of been something new with more money. Today around noon my boss (director) and a manager that works for him had a closed door conversation. Afterwards he approached me and the conversation went like this. He initially tried to say the offer was not set in stone, and that he thinks I would be better in my current role because this is a better fit for my intellect. That a different opportunity would happen down the line and that would be a better fit for me. He wanted me to agree with this but I kept it short and just said if that's what you think is best. Then he started to backtrack the first part of the conversation and say that he knows what he said to me sounded like this was set thing. Then. He tried to convince me on how a lateral move like that would not benefit me that much and tried to then complement me on how great I do my current role and that next level opportunity will come sooner than later.

"Just published my first book, How to Write the Perfect Resume, free on Amazon. Check it out!",68,8oscfq,"Hey everyone,

A couple years ago I decided that I wanted to steer my career in a direction where I’d eventually be working for myself full time, and although I’m nowhere near close to that point yet, I’m really excited about this first fruit of my efforts.  A little background on me: graduated ten years ago, live in the Bay Area, and have worked at some of the more notable tech companies here in SV.  Due to the decent success I’ve had on the job front, I’ve always been the “go to” guy in my circle of friends and family members for resume help and general career advice, and I had never really thought much about this until I had the idea that I could turn it into a full\-blown career.  The idea stuck with me and one day, I just started writing and continued doing so pretty much every day since for the past couple years.  This week, I’m proud to say that my efforts have finally culminated in a real, tangible product that I think \(hope\) is ready for the world to see.

For this first book, I took everything I knew about how to write a great resume and condensed it down into a comprehensive, step\-by\-step guide that anyone can use to shape their resume in a way that will truly capture the attention of potential employers.  There’s a lot of advice out there\-\-some of it good, some of it bad\-\-and I wanted to put my own spin on what’s worked for me and the others who I’ve helped land their target jobs.  The end result is something I hope can truly help people avoid the mistakes that land their resumes in the dreaded black hole and get them one step closer to finding a meaningful, fulfilling career path.

Anyways, the book is available for free on Amazon Kindle through June 8th, so be sure to get your copy before the price goes up.

I have been on a war path to tailor my resume to jobs, same with cover letters, and have gotten nothing but commission only sales positions calling me (of which I did not apply for).

Obviously I can't just move without a job.  We are considering getting restaurant gigs so we are at least ""local"" and can take an interview easily.

Am I doing something wrong? It takes me so long to find a new job.,66,b084n6,"Partially venting, also looking for any advice.

I’ve had progressive growth through my career. But I’m not happy where I am. I feel like I keep landing in bad situations with jobs.

I had a job with low pay and no movement so I moved to a better paying job at a higher level. I got promoted but the commute was 5hrs round trip and after a few years I left. 

I took a closer job with higher pay, different industry but had a boss that was very very mean. They also lied about the job description.
I left after a few years for a higher position and more pay. But I’m not happy with the commute, the job, it’s far and I work alone and not learning and no support just find myself stressed all the time, and always being thrown in the fire never being shown even the systems. 

Between each job it’s taken about a year to get an offer. 
Either I get interviews that don’t tell me the pay, just ask me to meet them but I can’t take time off not even knowing if it’s a match (is it so hard to tell me a range?) or I get to final round and not selected. 
Been applying for 8 months. I’d take a pay cut for happiness but it’s like I don’t even get calls anymore. 
I want a simple, low stress job but it’s like my experience doesn’t allow me to get that.
I even had one person tell me she thought I’d be bored and move on so they didn’t select me. I’m tired of the high stress.
Seems like I can’t even get another job doing the same thing nevermind something different.
It’s weird because I’m a fast learner but companies don’t give you a chance unless you are straight from the industry. I don’t want to be in the industry. 
I’m frustrated and I’ve applied to any job that I could see myself doing and nothing for 8 months! Haven’t even had a call back in 6 months. 
I just feel so defeated and stuck. Like I can’t even use my pto bc I’m saving it for interviews and I’m just burned out. The company barely gives time off as it is.

Entry level jobs that teach valuable skills?,66,a9nmrn,"I'm 22 and feel like I have no real skills that would help me get a decent job. Right now I'm an Aerospace Warehouse Support. For the most part I answer emails from branches and ship parts out to them or fulfill orders for customers. For example Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and a bunch of other places you've probably never heard of. I get paid $13 an hour (30 hours a week) and a little bonus every month if we meet certain goals. I want to start saving up for a house but I need something that pays more. Which I understand in order to get paid more I need a better job and those require skills.

So my question is what are some jobs a person without lots of experience or degree could get that teach valuable skills that could help me get a better job down the line? Also that pay better. (Excluding anything that has to do with sales, automobiles, and construction) 

As of right now I'm leaning to going to work for FedEx. My GF has a friend who is not the smartest guy, but after working there part-time through college he is now making over $100k a year. My GF's sister's boyfriend has been working there for around a year or so and is making $19 hour which probably isn't much to some people, but that's night and day difference for me.",2018-12-26 12:46:20
How to find my path after 19 years at age 43?,65,8x4cxi,"This is going to be a long read, and I apologize for it.  I've written this over 4 days and have tried to explain my situation as best as I can.  (It still seems to be a book, and I'm sorry about that.)

I graduated from college (BS, Economics) from a well-known mid-atlantic university in 1999. I was young, and I didn’t have a lot of direction. I wound up taking a job in Healthcare as an entry-level pharmacy technician, which was completely unrelated to my major. Initially, I had planned to stay there a year, two tops. By that time, I would figure out what I wanted to do and I’d start my destiny. But that’s not really how life works. I got very comfortable. I knew there was little to no upward mobility, but that was OK. The job was close to my home, my boss was friendly, the work was easy, and the hours were great. The pay wasn’t as high as I’d like, but for a recent college grad, living back at home, the money was just fine to both help my parents with bills and save some cash.

A few years after my hire date, I decided to continue working there while doing something I always wanted to do. I wanted to run my own company. I had/have solid IT skills. I was “that guy” that everyone went to in order to fix computer problems. Family, friends, and even at work I became the unofficial IT guy.  (With that added responsibility did come increased pay.)  I decided to monetize that, and I used my experience and knowledge to start an IT company. I went from 4 clients to over 1,100 (about 82&#37; of those repeats) and wound up running a very successful IT company for over a decade. I was young, I was able to work my 9-5, see clients till 9 or 10PM, work till 4AM in my basement repairing machines, and then get 3 hours of sleep to go back to my day job. I did this for about a decade, working most weekends from ages 24-35. Finally burning out, along with the industry changing, I closed the company when the disparity between income and expenses was getting too close. My wife and I also started our family, and raising kids and working 20 hours a day was not feasible for my own health or for being a parent.

I developed a good source of income from my computer company on-top of the “ok” income from the 9-5. I was able to start two 529’s. My children’s college will essentially be funded even if I never earn another dollar. I was also able to create a decent high five-figure nest egg which I have invested and don’t intent to touch.

19 years later, while I have moved up a little to Senior Lead Pharmacy Technician, the company has gone through several changes in ownership, and is now owned by a big company that you would definitely know.  I'm overpaid in the industry due to the length of time I've been there.  I’ve declined recent promotions because the local leadership is very poor, and the income increase for those positions is widely out of touch with the increase in responsibilities. Those positions would very likely kill me.  Very recently, many of my coworkers have resigned which has in some cases tripled the work the remaining people have to do which has presented not only unsafe situations for patients, but has induced a health-scare for me as a result of being overworked. My blood pressure skyrocketed the other day to unsafe levels, and it was completely work-induced. I don’t want to die at a desk in a job that I have come to hate.  I've come to the awakening that my departure is overdue.

I’m now 43 years old. I’m more or less in the same job I started in when I was 25. The roles have changed, the pay has increased, the responsibilities have increased. I need to find a new job, but I’m completely lost. I haven’t been on an interview in 19 years. I know how to write a resume, and I updated mine about 2 years ago in preparation for a move. I’m very well respected at my job, but they are suspicious as to why I don’t want the promotions. I am their lead performer in terms of branch metrics, as laid out by the company’s expectations. I simply no longer want to work under this atmosphere of the current leadership because it’s impacting my health. I’m at the point where I’m mentally OK with resigning before finding something else, but I know that is not a smart move. It is time for me to put my big guy pants on, and get out into the world and do something better to support my wife and kids.

**Here is my problem**: I don’t know what I can offer someone.  Not to get caught up in the buzzwords, but I’m reliable, dependable, honest, both public and private. I show up to work during snow storms of any amount, and I work really well with coworkers - I'm well respected by my peers, and I have become an ""unofficial leader"" among them.  I am a team player, and I’m not there to see only myself excel. I am good with computers, and I have 20 years of really solid customer service skills that I use to make even the most unhappy customer a happy one. A lot of that comes from working in healthcare; these people are sick and have little to no guidance other than me. More of that skill comes from when I ran my company. It was only me; I did sales, cold calls, marketing, advertising, on-site repairs, workshop repairs, customer service, billing, all of the financials, and when something went wrong, I had to be there to take the hit, accept responsibility and make the situation right for the customer.  I wore all of the hats.

Even with all of the above, I feel like I still don’t know what I can offer someone, and I have no idea what industry would be mutually beneficial based upon my skill set(s).

Can someone point me in the right direction? I know that this is a very general question, but even resources where I could go to find out where I might fit in would be helpful.   For my own health, I have to step out of acute healthcare. My IT skills have waned a little bit, and I’m definitely not up on the newest and greatest. I have no certifications, not even A+ back in the day. I just knew how to talk to people, I could fix things, and keep people happy. I could work the magic, and it worked out for everyone.

I just feel really lost, and it is my own fault. I’m just looking for help.  I'm not opposed to any industry, just not acute healthcare.  My heart (and body) are no longer in it.

Thanks for your time if you read this far, I really appreciate it.",2018-07-08 23:14:44
My boss has given me a month to come up with a 5 year plan. What do I do?,66,8w13xl,"Hi everyone. A little background on me to start.

I am a 24 year old woman. I never got a degree after high school due to personal reasons and instead got into retail. I worked my way up really quickly to manager, but then my mum got sick. I got an office job working inbound calls Monday to Friday (so I could visit her regularly on weekends). The company is one of the top 10 well known companies in my country. 

I have been there 9 months now and I love it. It's a company that I personally trust, it has been extremely good to me and it's the first time I feel valued. In return, I have put my hard work into it. At around 7 months I was promoted to where I am now, which is handling complaints and investigating if were liable to any damages we might cause customers. 

I had my first quality assurance review yesterday and scored pretty well. My boss confided in me that she sees a lot of potential in me and compared me to someone who started where I did and now in a senior management position. She said that if my score is the same or better next time, she wants to know where I want to be in five years and help me get there. She mentioned that the company could even put me on study leave if that's work it took. 

The problem is, I feel numb! This could be a life changing opportunity and I dont want to ruin it. I know that I was to be customer focused. I strive for customer service and i want to strive to make sure the customers are getting the best experience. 

I would love any advice on this, whether it be where I want to go, if I want to study.. I live in a very expensive city and the only reason I do is because I live with my parents. I would love to be able to move out and not struggle too much. ",2018-07-04 15:00:17
Last day of work. Should I throw awful managers under the bus ?,66,861mt9,"Hi all

Today is my last day . I’ve been with my current company for 6 years. 

Two years ago we got new managers that have been nightmares . They gossip about staff to other staff, don’t help at all, talk down to us, abuse their power and don’t know what they’re doing in general.

I got a new office job starting Monday and I used my original manager as my job reference .

At the end of my shift today I have an exit interview with HR and I’m not sure if I should just go quietly or if I should let them know that I am leaving because of the horrible new management (I’m the third person to quit just this month alone)

EDIT:
Another thing they did that irritates me ; after giving two weeks notice I used a sick day . When I went to enter it into the system my 5 sick days turned into 0. I went to HR and they said someone went into the system and deleted my sick days , HR fixed it for me. These are the kind of managers I’m dealing with so I am becoming less and less worried about burning bridges I have no desire to work in this field again 

UPDATE:

I had the meeting. It started off with some paper work and I decided I wasn’t going to say anything ... until they asked me. 

I let them know what the biggest issues were and how they could be improved. At the end of the day I don’t want to ever go back to that company/field and it’s not helping anyone if I stayed quiet. They were awful managers and I didn’t want to protect  them. ",2018-03-21 15:22:02

Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?,62,bnojli,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm fresh out of college (business law bachelor degree, top 10%) and 3 months into a big 4 company as a tax consultant and I have my first evalution interview in a few days. They are going to rate my performance and I'm supposed to give them feedback and where I see my future in the company.

&#x200B;

The thing is: I hate the job. Mostly because I discovered that I hate tax (even though I'm barely doing tax law, I'm a glorified accountant right now and I hate calculating and numbers). Partly because they lied to me at the job interview about home office and flexible working. They also won't train me because the company policy prohibits this (the seniors won't get a promotion if they train new colleagues - aka wasting time). They literally just dumped me alone in another room at the end of the building away from my colleagues the first 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a new job since 2 months but it's tough if you are fresh out of college and working full time. So I'm thinking if I should tell them that I want into another department on another location which focuses more on actual law (preferably not tax) and with less numbers to calculate. This is super risky because I'm still on probation so they could easily fire me. So I'm not sure if I'm better off just to continue looking for another job? But not sure if I can sit through this.

&#x200B;

What should I do ?

Have you ever written directly to your CEO?,65,at29nl,"I am working in a 90'000+ company that is huge. I have already met my CEO during a smaller event (only 40 people) and could talk to him. He won't recognize me today, I think...

How do you find time to learn?,68,aniopt,"This is a super simple question. How can busy parents incorporate learning (reading work related books, articles) to further develop their career.

"I work at Amazon UK, I have proof Senior Management lied to us, and screwed a few of us over, How do I write this letter?",65,ad1scj,"Hey there, 

&#x200B;

I know a look of people like to bash for working at amazon, and it's true it's terrible to work at, but if you are the lucky few  your job their isn't to bad, and well it pays my bills, some days you don't feel like a slave. 

&#x200B;

Now that Christmas is over the work at amazon warehouses goes down, so they need to say bye to the temp hires they hired, and the Blue badges who are hired by amazon, need to get moved around. So about 3-4 months ago, they needed to move people from one side of the warehouse to the other, to balance workflow, basically what happened is the managers picked who they would class lazy workers and gave them a letter saying they are getting moved over, this was with no notice at all, and they were given the worst shifts possible, over the weekend, plus nights since whom i work with work at night, but during the weekdays, so of course everyone was unhappy and complained, so this time around HR, wanted to be more fair about it, they gave us more notice and a chance to volunteer to move over to the other side of the building, where we also get to pick three different shifts we would like most out of all the available shifts. they needed 60 people in total out of our side of the warehouse from every shift, the rule also was, if not enough people volunteered, they will pick the people who most recently got a Blue badged  (moved from agency and hired by amazon), and So if this was true, I would be on the list to get moved, so the smartest thing to do is to volunteer, and secure a Good shift and not get stuck with a bad one, So in the meeting we sit with our Senior Manager, before we wait for the last person to arrive, we just have general chats before he explains the process and asks if anyone wants to go, In this meeting the important thing i noted is when he said, They wouldn't force you to go from a Night Shift to a Day shift since you are used to your money you get weekly, its about £40 higher, it adds up, and since we all get over worked, no one would wanna get paid less. So with that it gave me more confidence that volunteering would be the best thing in my shoes to do, And I do, so the next week comes, I get my letter and I see that they put me on a Day shift but even worse Mid day, so you work from 12 to 12 at night, with the Day pay lol, now we all at amazon love to gossip and complain to each other, so i find out from my Manager that this Girl is leaving to the other side of the building and I'd be good for her job, she got to sit down xD so i was Like YESSS< but then i was like shit i volunteered to go too, he was like you weren't on the list to go, which just got me mad, since HR lied Senior management lied, They clearly got to pick again who could stay and go, they picked me since I'm not lazy, well I am but they don't catch me, and another point is, this other girl who Got her blue badge way way before anyone and should of been safe, got forced to go, and She got the shift I picked as my first Option, which makes the whole volunteer system bullshit and meaningless in the first place. so of course I go to explain to my manager and he tells me to write a letter, to someone i haven't herd of, or ever seen, in the building. i just want some advise on how I put a letter together, since clearly from this mess Im not much of a writer. 

&#x200B;

I know that if i send a letter to the write person in the building something could be done, for someone in my shoes its not much of a big deal, i can still get to work, the £40 less isn't a huge deal, but what if i didn't have a car, or access to work at that time, or really need the extra £40, people who were forced to move over again, are in those situations, maybe exposing their whole process of moving people was a shit show again, maybe they can do it fucking properly.

"new job lied about working from home and is now at location, any advice?",65,8t0bfl,"I took new job to get out of a bad work situation and happy to either work on location or from home which is common in my field esp since I dont work with a team-- I was open. 

I accepted the job, I was told several times I was going to be a wfh employee from HR and have emails to show from HR saying this and docs they had me fill out for working at home and criteria for internet etc, that they canceled scheduled orientation date since I was remote.

The background check due to an error on their end took 2mths. Since knowing once background clears I will be remote job I decide to move in with fiance who works further away and this was the perfect chance with having the time before start. I set up new home office and picked out place with extra bedroom for office.

Boss now tells me this isn't the case. I addressed this clearly what I was told and how I was moving based on this info but I am being told that was a mistake and need to be in office everyday and can't even have one day - didn't matter what HR said.

I am stuck with a far commute that I didn't sign up for. I asked recruiter in interview what the hours are, he responded 9-5 now I am told 8-5. I wouldnt mind at all if was told upfront but now that I have a longer commute with a longer work day. I've had long commutes in past and really worked hard to avoid this by asking questions. 

I am discouraged from this horrible onboarding exp. I am not sure what I should do. I feel lied to. Its hard to take time off in the start of a new job to interview. Since I already discussed and was shot down not sure what more to do without looking bad myself. Leaving a job so early in does not look good but I really did not expect this. 

If you have any advice on how to handle this, it's great appreciated. Thanks!",2018-06-22 13:36:34
I'm 30. I want to change career...but to what?,62,bbjaf4,"I read a bunch of articles that suggested identifying my skills, what I enjoyed and not enjoyed, to help figure out what I want to do. See below. Tried a few different sectors. But I still feel clueless. 

I'm looking for suggestions on career direction. Can anyone help please?

* **Customer service/sales** \- Don't enjoy being at the front line. Worked in retail/fashion and events management, both of which I lost interest very quickly. Also worked at a healthcare clinic startup, where thankfully instead of directly selling treatments to patients, I briefly managed the sales team (interim till Sales Manager came on) and drafted the initial sales strategy (enjoy).
* **Graphic and product packaging designs** \- know the basics of Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign. Did some basic work - logos, website wireframes, print materials, photo editing, and product packaging designs for a small skincare line. Very therapeutic, but in the long run I don't have the patience to...well, echoing another redditor's comment, explain why this shade of colour is better than your grandma's choice.
* **Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable** \- I like looking at numbers once in a while. I was pretty good with Maths back in high school, though ended up pursuing a BA, so my maths is somewhat rusty. I also enjoy working with Excel, but majority of my roles only uses Excel on a beginner level - rarely requires the usage of Vlookup, pivot table, spreadsheet modelling etc.
* **Digital marketing** \- basic familiarity. Had a 3 month exposure to it a couple of years ago as an assistant. I've been reading up on how to get in, but not 100% sure I will like it. Partly because...wouldn't it be ironic to be in the field but doesn't use/have facebook, instagram etc? Further, when I had the opportunity to manage social media for a company, I wasn't motivated enough to make it happen.
* **Project management skills** \- currently pursuing a PMP certification. Based in a place where there's a very conservative, certificate-oriented hiring culture. Even if being certified in PMP isn't a requirement, I've been told that it provides some assurance for the employer (yes, I am aware that being certified doesn't translate to doing well at the job, but unfortunately many conservative employers here think certified = excel at the job)
* **Setting up/improving business processes/procedures** \- worked at a startup where process/procedures were either not in place or could be improved. What I did were relatively small-scale processes and procedures, but it was nice to be the one to set up or improve them. At another job, I also restructured the front desk operations.
* **Brand management** \- took an intro course, which I had fun with. So the concepts are there. But I don't have a huge amount of brand management experience. While I did help build the brand at the startup, my involvement was mostly in designs with some strategy planning.
* **HR -** familiar, as I was the unofficial HR assistant/manager in two of my previous roles. Not a path I want to pursue.
* **Business Strategy** \- Only had a small snippet of this in helping the startup refine the strategy and vision.

I also like researching and investigating things, and learn new softwares. I tried learning how to code, which is nice when I'm learning leisurely. But I would be terrified to code as a full-time job.

Sorry for the long read. Thanks for reading this far. Hope that I can get some help in brainstorming this.",2019-04-10 10:43:41
Can't Do Business Professional Dress for Interview -> Automatic Disqualification?,66,axpojg,"So I was contacted this morning to set up a meeting with the hiring manager of a local marketing consulting firm to discuss an entry level position. In a confirmation email, they asked that I come dressed business professional, which I take to mean a suit. The problem is that I don't own one. Since the interview is tomorrow at 9:45 am and my current job is second shift, I will have no time to get one. The firm is also a 90 minute drive for me, so I won't have time to grab anything tomorrow morning. 

So I guess I have two options. 1) Go as is and hope for the best or 2) ask to reschedule the interview ASAP to give me time to find something. I'm 29 and have never worked in marketing. I can do the nice end of business casual. What should I do? Would they disqualify me based on this?",2019-03-05 22:18:11

Is it okay to have different versions of your CV that highlight different work experience?,65,9yxtrj,"I have 13 years of nonprofit experience, mostly in comms/project management, with a lot of adjunct experience in partnerships and digital marketing/social media. I'm applying to a social impact organization that has a few positions open. The one I'd really like to interview for is a strategic partnerships role (a bit of a reach as this hasn't been my direct focus, but I certainly have enough experience to make a case for applying), but there is also a social media manager position I am qualified for. Since I am sort of an outreach/marketing/comms generalist, I can tweak my CV to go a bunch of different directions depending on what I want to highlight (can't say it all!).

GM position at 19???,60,9i7vr3,"Hey everyone.
I'm a soon to be college grad, turning 20 soon. I've been working at this bagel bakery that I love dearly for the past year or so. I moved quickly from cashier, to line cook, to manager and then to baker. I've been given a lot of responsibility with some of the specials and stuff like that. 

Anyway my general manager is leaving soon, and she told me she'd like to train me as her replacement. This means I'd be getting a salary right out of college.

How to get job experience when all jobs require experience?,61,9ceiu9,"I recently decided to switch career fields and I keep hitting this roadblock. Every job I want to apply for requires 2-5 years of experience.

Some personal background information: I'm a military veteran with 4 years of experience doing analytical research and maintaining databases. I have a degree in English with 6 years of editing and 10 years of technical writing experience. Last year I went back to school to get my MBA and I graduate in the spring. 

This summer I attempted to get a slew of different internships ranging from PR to marketing to consulting and someone with more experience got picked every single time (isn't the point of an internship to actually get that experience!?).

"I got a raise and promotion, but it feels like a pay cut...Can you get a raise to a lower FTE salary than you had the previous year?",61,bdzaj7,"Hi all. So I got a raise and promotion today but I’m not excited at all about it. 

The promotion is easy. New title more responsibility. Cool.

The raise though feels like a pay cut. So last year my yearly salary was raised to $55k in June, which makes some of the math complicated. Apparently I was to make $52000 for the year, Counting the mid year raise. 

However, I had a family emergency and needed to take some unpaid leave, so I went down to 30 hours a week for a few months. I ended up making $50k in total at the end of the year (counting unpaid leave).

Fast forward to today. I get my promotion and a “raise” to $53500 a year. Apparently the got my 2018 salary from HR and gave me a 5% raise off of what I make last year. So my full time 2019 salary was counted off my reduced unpaid family leave salary of 2018. 

This makes no sense. Is this how raises work? All things equal I think the raise should have been based on my FTE salary, not the FMLA one? Because working full time this year I’m making less than last year? That and now I have a lot more responsibility. How to I talk to my company about this? I hate confrontation but this doesn’t seem right.

Tl;dr: made $55k, had to take unpaid leave, actually made $50k, got raise based on that.",2019-04-17 00:13:00

I'm almost 40 years old and have no degree. Can you help with direction and degree recommendations?,63,a8bmpq," I am a person who is 40 years old with no degree and I am concerned about job security and the next 25 years of work.  
 

In my teenage years I took vocational and career classes.  I started  college but had to work instead.  I have worked my way up the past 23  years as a draftsman, a cad modeller, a tool maker, a designer and now  an engineering manager for the aerospace industry.  Most of what I do  now is Solidworks design.  I have experience in mechanical, electrical,  hydraulics, pneumatic systems and many various software systems.  I  design turn-key packages that include all of these elements.

I also do  some light programming in PLC, VBA and have previous experience with  HTML, PHP, Pearl, SQL.  I love computers and tech.  Building and repairing  PC's has been a hobby since I had a Tandy 6mhz.   I also build stuff.  Book  cases, picnic tables, bathrooms, kitchens, full size decks... doesn't  matta.  I can calc some hydraulic forces for you and spec cylinders and fittings, or drop you a new stainless dual tub with sprayer and disposal in a few hours.  
 

I can obviously tell that times have changed.  
 

Upset about the election results, my own employer has started a crusade  against ""uneducated"" people.   He also changed my title to strike the  word ""Engineering"" from it and replace it with ""Design"" as that doesn't  imply ""Fake engineer"".  It does not seem to matter that I have designed  millions of dollars of product for him, having completed close to a  thousand designs over the last 20 years.   I am still paid very well  regardless.  As acting Design Manager I do manage actual engineers with  actual degrees (is this all sounding crazy?) and I TEACH them our  industry.  
 

Anyhow.  It appears I need some papers to support the idea that I'm not  stupid.   The worst part of it is when I tell anyone how I make a  living, the very first comment is ""Where did you go to school?"" and I  sheepishly have to explain that I'm technically uneducated.  
 

I'm also concerned that if I needed a new job in the next 20 years I may  not be hired because I do not have a degree.  I have a stunning amount  in 401K, investments as a safety net.  I currently have 2 houses, one of  which I rent, and 4 income streams.  Therefore I feel that I do not  need the king of degrees, I just need groundwork to be considered by  companies.  I feel by 2030 no one will be allowed to WORK without a  degree, as even being a secretary now requires a degree >.<  
 

I am not sure if I want a degree in mech or aerospace.  With the second  half of my life, I may want to focus more on computer systems, or  perhaps focus on management.  But I need a direction to get started.   I  was also looking at the online schooling, as I work 10 hour days and  have a family.  If I could start with an associates that could later be  used toward various bachelors that would be very helpful.  I really do  not know a lot about the education process itself.  
 

I was also thinking I could add certs and licenses too, in various trade  skills.  I could also get a cert for Solidworks Certified Professional  and whatnot pretty easily, but never thought that would actually ""mean""  something on a resume.

My CEO changed my job entirely in one day and now requires me to be out of town 2 weeks of the month. I'm a single mother and need advice. Can he do this?,59,7cng4p,"I have been with a start up type company for 3 years. It's kind of confusing because I have been working in the same position but serving 2 of their sister companies as well. My boss told me that the companies split my salary.
About a year ago - my paycheck source changed. Over the course of 3 years, the name of the parent company paying me has changed 3 times.
And a few months ago, one of those companies (that I helped get on the INC 5000)list laid everyone off. The CEO of that company did it from his private jet on his way to a luxurious vacation and posted about it on Facebook. No one was happy.
My CEO has always been pretty fair imo. But, it's been very strange trying to understand all the moving parts.
Last Friday he told me that I am moving exclusively to the OTHER company and I will most likely be required to travel 2weeks of every month. TWO WEEKS.
I am a mom and I honestly don't know how I'm going to do this. I make 6 figures and this is very, very important income. But, I am very concerned.
4 hours after this happened....at 10pm on Friday night -- my NEW CEO emailed and asked for changes to be made to an existing project I completed months ago. He wanted it ASAP. I couldn't get in touch with the editor, so I told him I would do my best.
He told me to call him after 1pm on Saturday to discuss my new role and projects -- I called twice. Left messages and he never returned them.

Is it time for me to move on if acquiring a Masters isn't a valid reason to request a pay increase?,63,br140q,"This is a throwaway, family knows my actual account and I'm kind of embarrassed asking about this.

&#x200B;

I took a known pay cut going to work for this University, it's a top-rated school in the US and rationalized the pay cut with the benefit of free school. Three years in I've acquired my Masters (Electrical Engineering) and approached my boss for what can be done about increasing my compensation to reflect my new skill-set/work I've been doing. I'm currently enrolled in a PhD program for the school, Masters was just a little victory, but I'm not making much more than when I started. Boss told me it's an HR issue, he can do what he can but in the end it comes to their decision and they have a bad history with not crediting their own institution's degrees as a valid reason for pay increase.

&#x200B;

I want to continue for the PhD but I found out one of the employees we just hired with not much more than a Masters is making significantly more than me. To make it worse he's working under me as I've started to work point on most of the work I'm involved in. I'm at least another two years from finishing my PhD but given the fact I'm making close to 3x less my current market value I'm finding it hard to stay versus finding a new place and juggling a more demanding workplace with remaining schoolwork/research.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just at a loss for what I should do. I want to talk to HR or someone involved in the process but I don't even know where to begin.

Edit for clarification:

This position is a full time staff position at a University, not a TA or RA position. If I was in an RA/TA position the Masters would have increased the stipend amount due to the increase in education level.",2019-05-20 23:47:50

Which Career is Less Stressful: Accounting or Programming?,59,aowmj0,"I've been deciding between Accounting and Programming. I just want to make sure I make the right choice based on my personality type. I'm a high anxiety person so its important that I choose a career I can handle well.

I've done some very basic skimming of both fields on the internet just to get a taste of what it's like. I don't know Jack, so I could be completely wrong about what I'm about to say below

Accounting looks good to me because it appears to have a stable workflow. It seems like kind of job that you can just sit down and get to right away. And it seems like a job that is more mechanical and streamlined (less mentally taxing and less likely to make your head blow up). A job that you can digest easily in small incremental portions. 

Programming looks interesting but I heard its for those problem-solver type people. The kind who like puzzles and brain games. That's not me at all. I never had an interest in puzzles as a kid and I still don't. It also seems like the kind of job where you frequently run into problems and lose your head over it. So that's a negative side for me. 

On the other hand, the idea of creating something from scratch (a program) is fascinating to me. I am a creative person at heart. Just not sure if I'll enjoy the act of programming because I never really did it personally so I don't know what it's like.

Which of these careers is less stressful? And which of them has a more flexible working schedule? I'm considering private accounting btw (which I hear is less stressful than public accounting)

A flexible work schedule is important to me. I've heard that a lot of programmers work on their laptops and choose to work whenever and wherever as long as they finish the work by the deadline. Is this true?

A new senior colleague is creating chaos for my entire team. What do we do?,58,bgtsxi,"I work in a very small private sector PR business that I'm really passionate about my job and my team. It's been amazing from the get-go. Everyone is super friendly and supportive... Almost like a family. We have an open door policy where if anyone has a suggestion, we here them out. We have some really talented folk on our team who are absolute pros and the majority of us are in our 20s.

&#x200B;

A new senior manager has started recently. In his first two weeks, he scrapped my work for a project behind my back and didn't even tell me until he had completed it and shown it to the client without me present. He has since been attempting to do large parts of my job without collaborating with me on anything. This has pushed the project back 4 weeks because he's redone all the work I did beforehand. When I asked why this had happened, he had no reason and believed with his experience, it would be better. It turns out, at the last minute, I've had to patch up this project because he's not completed vital parts after taking complete ownership of it which I have had to allow. His work is incomplete. If he had sat with me and told me he'd like to complete this project, I would have asked to work alongside him and go through it anyway. Instead, he's just grabbed it and ran.

&#x200B;

He has held more than 5 meetings about my projects without me etc. On multiple occasions, he has spoken down to me and told me he has over 20 years worth of experience when I'm trying to advise him on what I know.. He does this and highlights the number of years since he knows I'm in my 20s. I vented this to a trusted high up colleague who is really understanding. I used to work extremely close with my boss and now this guy has pushed me out of any decision making processes that involve my work. He treats me like a 14 year old girl.

&#x200B;

Since this has happened, this guy has been doing the same to other team members. He has ignored their advice on things they have years experience in and has rerouted projects and wasted time. Everyone is unhappy with him. No one is being listened to. At lunch, most people just rant and wave about how bad things are. Projects still get done but that's because we all run around and patch up the issues before sign off.

&#x200B;

We have raised complaints about him and it's only been 1.5 months since he started however, we have not been taken seriously. This colleague has since been upgraded to an even higher roll and I know he's got the top dogs wrapped around his finger whereas he's been undermining everyone else who has to do all these projects from start to finish.

&#x200B;

I find this unfair because I know I would be kicked out of the door and I wouldn't pass a probationary period if 3 staff members had already raised complaints.. but somehow because it's much older, he's just passed go and collected £200... Quite literally. The guy acts and talks like a politician. He doesn't give straight answers and you don't actually know what he's doing at all for half the day.

&#x200B;

We do not have a HR department and there hasn't been any formal process of anyone high up noting down our complaints or putting a plan into action. We try and speak to this guy and work with him to the best of our ability whilst being kind and considerate regardless of how he's been. But he's happier to act like the person who's holding it all together while we're drowning in frustration. In total, I've raised 2 complaints about him and nothing has been done.

Any advice would be massively appreciated.",2019-04-24 15:07:10
Which salary estimation site should I trust/cite when determining salary requirements?,60,ajpixf,"Hey internet! 

So I’m trying to figure out how much I should actually be getting paid. Surprise. I’ve been in my field nearly ten years and have had “superior performance” at every job — except probably my current one, but that’s a different story. 

Context: I’ve been interviewing with a few new companies and have gotten mixed reviews on salary range. I told one company (role reporting to CEO) my minimum was $60k and they said that was too much. For another job (reporting to VP), I told them $60k and the recruiter told me “I’m putting down $70k-$75k — that’s what you should be asking for.” They’re both in similar industries — the second one is arguably less responsibility, so what gives?

I’m interviewing with a third company that I really, really like so far, but salary hasn’t come up yet. This is another reporting to CEO job, same industry (SaaS dev). The recruiter already spilled the beans that she thinks I’m perfect, so I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the next round. 

The problem: I have no clue what to ask for in terms of salary! The last two interviews have totally thrown me for a loop with their $20k difference. Doing salary research, it seems every single salary site puts me in the $55k-$60k range, but salary.com puts me at $80k-$88k. 

Which do I trust? Do I risk losing a possibly amazing opportunity (if offered) because I asked for too much? Or do I undersell myself and hope for another crazy recruiter to tell me “oh no, here’s an extra $15k”?

My location has had a surge in tech which has been increasing some salaries — I’ve seen recs for engineers offering Bay Area salaries. I know I’m worth more than the average person in my field — but I was (underpaid, admittedly) making $75k in the Bay Area last year and now that I’m in a lower COL, I’m just... confused.

How can I supplement my skills to become a data analyst?,61,ahcbto,"So I worked as a “data analyst” for 2 years in IT Security but all I did was track metrics and pull data when other people couldn’t figure out how. I wouldn’t consider it actual analysis. I then got a job in retail analytics which had been my goal but it was at a startup and they had financial trouble so I was let go after only 3 months.

I want to continue doing retail analytics or customer analytics or product analytics, but I have 0 domain knowledge. I have some of the technical skills required (python, sql, excel, statistics) but no experience in the industry.

I noticed lots of postings ask for Business Analyst experience. Would it be worthwhile to get a certificate in Business Analysis? This would not be a degree or anything, it’s a continuing education certificate offered by my school. Would employers think a certificate is useful or would it be a waste of money?

I haven’t seen any courses that focus on retail analysis so I don’t know how to get experience in it since no one will hire me without experience. What kind of courses should I look for? Would they be under marketing or sociology or something? Are their courses that would teach me about Product analysis?

Is it OK to still be searching & applying for jobs even though I recently started a new one?,57,a5254u,"I’ve made some posts here in the past and am very thankful for the advice I’ve received. In October, I started a full time position in my field. I took a decent pay cut from my previous job out of my field in attempts to get some experience. It wasn’t my dream job or anything, but it was something to help make connections/make myself more valued in my field.

The pay difference is rough. Lack of enthusiasm is prominent in the company due to this. A lot of my coworkers say the pay is the main reason they hate the job— even after “promotions”. It’s your typical entry level job. It’s about 15k lower than average (our salary is 34k). 

My issue is, I have a lot of experience. Even my boss told me while interviewing me I would be underpaid based on my qualifications, but despite sending out hundreds of applications, I was never invited to interviews.

"I lied and it got me in a stupid career pickle, any suggestions?",59,9fc5m7,"**Backstory:** I started my career about 2 years ago in a junior IT position, and a salary to match. Well, I've grown professionally a lot since then and thought I'd start looking around for an opportunity that might pay more. I got 3 offers, all in the +10% range, and chose one of them that I liked.

Well, when I told my current company that I'd be moving on, they wanted to know how much the new place was offering, and what it'd take for me to stay. I gave them a number that seemed astronomical to me, and I thought they'd never accept. Well, they did. Today they offered me an annual salary just shy of twice my current, a position as lead engineer, and a relocation package to move to the company headquarters. Basically my dream job.

**The problem:** When they initially asked me how much the other place's offer was, I gave them a number a bit higher than it actually was. I don't know why, but it was really stupid. I guess I said that out of spite since I felt they had been underpaying me. The manager that talked with me about this (upper management actually, not my regular manager) requested a copy of that offer letter as part of whatever processing they do to get me into the new position. I said I'd get it to him....

What should I do??? I'm someone who values honesty, and this just makes me feel really really bad. If I confess, it makes me look stupid and dishonest. I have no logical reason to not send it over.

"I got offered a high-paying, once in a lifetime opportunity job that I feel I am not qualified for. Should I take the job?",59,9aaba8,"I currently have my own business with 2 partners that is doing pretty well.
We have been in talks of me leaving the company and selling my share to them. It's kind of hard to explain why I am leaving my own company, despite it being successful and only getting bigger. But I feel like  it's not challenging enough for me and I am stuck in a rut and not learning and growing, so I want to go work for another company where I can learn and cover up my ""weak spots"" in areas I don't know well.

My partners are supportive of my decision and said there's an ownership spot for me if I ever decide to come back, even if it's years down the line.

Anyway, on to the topic of the title.
A CEO of a very big and well-known company in our industry somehow got wind of me leaving my company and looking for a job (not sure how since only a few people know right now), and called me to ask for a meeting. I met with him and he offered me a very high-paying job running one of his company's departments. I was taken aback my this offer. It is very lucrative and a position most people would kill for. However, I personally believe I am not qualified. I know this CEO from my previous job, where we would interact constantly, so he knows my experience for the most part, which is why it is surprising that he offered this position to me.

I am not sure what to do. I feel like even though I am under-qualified, I can read and study and learn what I need to, and in a few months be somewhat qualified. They also said they will train me. I did want a challenging job and this job will definitely be tough.

My friends and family think I would be stupid to not take the job, and the worst-case scenario would be I get fired but would still learn a lot during my time there even if that happens. They also think I AM qualified and just have low self-confidence, which I admit has always been a personal issue for me.

I was thinking of requesting another meeting and being honest to the CEO with my skills and what he expects, just so there are no surprises, would that be the best way to go about this?

Another complication is that if I take this position, I will technically be competing against the company I started, so that makes things even weirder for me.

"I am a 28-year-old college graduate stuck in a string of dead-end, service industry jobs. How can I make the leap to a proper career path after so many squandered years?",57,6mrny2,"(I originally posted this over in r/personalfinance before a redditor directed me over to this sub, which really seems to be a better fit for the problem I have. Over there, I got a lot of advice to the effect of going to a trade school or looking into things like technical writing or going back into transcription. This is all good advice, and I have been Googling up a storm researching these possibilities. But I am always willing to listen to people who have a better idea of how to handle this situation. Please, bury me in your tips and observations.)

My resume consists of food service for the most part, though I did spend nearly three years working both back and front of house in a brewery. I've also had stints as a package handler at UPS, some transcription work and a glorified cart mule at Home Depot and Wal-Mart as my first two jobs when I was around 19.
I have usually been employed since the age of 19, though there was a long slog in 2016 where I was unemployed. Thankfully, I got over that hump, and I have been working for Chipotle since September of 2016. It pays $9.00 an hour, which is enough for me to live on in a dirt cheap college town even at less than full-time hours, but I'm really just treading water. I'm not working toward anything, and I don't see any future here.

I am moving away very soon even if it means moving back in with my parents in Atlanta. I let myself get caught in a rut, living only for the weekend and grading my life on how many parties I had been to in the past month. I don't drink or smoke or do any drugs. I have no arrests or any kids or ex-spouses complicating my life, but I've still spent most of my 20s living like the dumb college kid I should have outgrown.

I am closer to 30 than 20 these days, and it has dawned on me that I locked myself out of a lot of opportunities by settling for less and just getting by. Most of my peers are out-earning me several times over with jobs and degrees in IT, medicine, accounting or the sciences. I, on the other hand, have a print journalism degree I'm not using after I realized that for all that I love the written word, I don't really like the nature of journalism all that much. The pay and hours were terrible, I felt like scum for leeching on tragedies, etc. So that's the long and short of it. My life has been fun but unproductive. I'm not asking to earn seven figures a year and take yearly trips to Fiji, but something's got to change or I'll be riding a cash register until I drop dead in my 80s.",2017-07-12 07:27:58

Being underpaid compared to a less experienced colleague. What should I do?,56,b4v4y5,"I have recently been told by a colleague (who joined the company this calendar year), that she is earning almost 15% more than me. Now, when I started I was not in much of a position to negotiate and was quite flatly told there was no budget to go higher on it. At this point I had a MSc but only a couple of internships to my name, my colleague had an MSc and one year of work experience in a similar company. So to an extent I understand why she would be earning more than me, although I do think the increase is somewhat shocking given she didn't negotiate her deal. After a year, I was given a 3% increase. I am trying to figure out what to do in this situation, as I feel I am not being fairly compensated for my work. I have been there two years now and am the longest serving member of the team (aside from my boss) by almost 2 years... I take a very active role in teaching new members of the team (which occurs a lot due to some very high turnover of staff, for varying reasons.. none to my knowledge due to any issues with the company or compensation). Yet I'm being paid significantly less than a colleague with a year less experience.

&#x200B;

I approached my boss about this on Friday, who has said that I will be getting the usual increase (I am pretty sure it's just an inflation based increase) and that they have a separate pot of money for promotions but that they don't think they can tap into that as it would not be a promotion (I have been turned down for this recently). They said they are going to ask to find out if there is anything they can do about it as they know it's not much of a motivation.

"Is there a job/career path that would allow me to work less hours and get paid less? Ultimately my goal is to work less than 40 a week, and I dont need much money.",53,9eps00,"Hello,

Currently a mechanical engineer with a bachelors. I hate 40 hour weeks. Its way too much. I still want to have some free time where I can continue to learn in.

Im currently looking into going into a new career. What kind of careers have options to work less hours, and get less pay that of course should come with less hours? My problem is, nearly all jobs seem to be 'all or nothing'. 40 hours, or 0. I guess I'm looking for a scaleable job. I just know that I would be infinitely happy with just 2 more hours each weekday.

"I'm 31(M) and need a career change ASAP, but what to do?",56,9djk5j,"Sorry for the long post, but I'm getting desperate and looking for help and so I think I need to be thorough here in order to provide all the pertinent information I can. 

I'm in my 4th year of doing software implementations and I hate it. I've worked for 3 different companies so far, switching because I always thought that I hated my job because of the companies that I worked for, but I've recently come to the conclusion that it's not the company, but more the actual type of work/industry that I just don't jive well with. I hate it because -

1. I'm overworked. I know this is a problem for a lot of people, but I really value work/life balance and I always end up working \~60 hours a week because there is just so much work to do all the time. I'm always overwhelmed. 
2. I don't care. I'm not passionate about implementing software solutions for large companies to help them save money on software purchases in the long run. When things get hard it's difficult to convince myself it's worth it because what I do doesn't matter to me. 
3.  It doesn't feel real. Working virtually via monitors and phones means the work that I'm doing doesn't feel tangible. I'm not out in the real world providing value in a physical way, which is discouraging. I'm working from home (which is kind of nice) and rarely ever seeing people in real life and all of the solutions I build are on customer servers that I never see the benefits from after I'm done with the project.
4. I constantly get shit on. Software is complicated and things break and/or need to be customized all the time. Clients hate this and even when it's not my fault at all I'm always the guy to get blamed first. This is taxing on me and drives my stress levels through the roof, which I truly believe is causing some real problems with my physical and mental health at this point. I'm constantly under a lot of pressure and project managers are constantly all over me to get work done faster, even when it's unrealistic. 

I chose this career path mainly because there is so much opportunity in the field and it's pretty lucrative (I make around $90k right now). Now I'm realizing that even if I was paid 50% more I still wouldn't want to do this anymore. It's time to figure out what to do next, but that's where things get complicated. I'm interested in a lot of fields, but of course each field has it's own issues and I'm trying to figure out what would work well for me. Some of the topics I'm interested in include -

1. Aviation. I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a kid and tried to go to flight school when I was 19, but I failed the medical exam for an issue that I've been dealing with since then so I might not be able to pass the exam now either (chronic kidney stones)
2. Construction. I've helped build 2 houses before over the course of 2 years and I really enjoyed it. I don't want to do anything too back breaking as I get older though. I would really like to flip houses or be a construction manager or something someday, just not sure how to do either of these without a lot of capital or experience at this point. 
3. Small business ownership. My dad owns a small business and it's worked out really well for him. I've always been interested in entrepreneurship, but taking the leap has always seemed too risky for me because I have student loan and medical debt, and also I'm not sure what kind of business to start (especially without any real startup capital). 

A couple of other important factors to consider in my decision making process here are the facts that my girlfriend, who I plan to marry, is a 3rd year medical student so we will likely be moving in a little under two years for her residency. Also I have 2 bachelor's degrees in business (Information Systems and International Business) which I still have about $20k of debt for. I also love travelling and being outdoors a whole lot. I like helping people and animals and hate corporate america with all of it's politics, bureaucracy, conference calls etc. I'm also a pretty good people person, even though what I do now is very technical I'm better at the business side of my job than I am at the technical side. 

Again I'm sorry for the novel of a post, I'm just really down in the dumps and trying to figure out what change to make in my life and I really feel like I need some 3rd party perspective on what might be a good direction to head in. Thanks for reading!  ",2018-09-06 18:12:04
Will a GPA below 3.0 in undergrad bar me from all grad programs 3-4 years later?,57,7z7aid,I received a B.S. in economics but had a 2.8 gpa after nearly failing a semester (had kidney failure).

Is it bad that I'm about to screw over my boss by denying a promotion he's worked really hard for me to get to join another company?,54,bor1kz,"Hello! I haven't been happy at my job for a while now. I could list the reasons why but I'll just add a couple: Low team morale, flawed product, substantial work limitations. The one thing I love about my job, however, is my manager. He cares about his team, is extremely dedicated to making us happy and to get the team working well. He knows I've wanted out for a few weeks, I would never admit, but about 4 people on our team left the company so he's pretty stressed, and broke the news that I wanted to join a different team in the organization. Instead of getting mad, he put in a good word for me and got me an interview (it'd be a promotion technically, just in a different department). 

&#x200B;

I had the interview and I kind of nailed it, and they said they wanted me to join but will have to go over logistics on when I can join. My manager kept me hired, has been treating me like this hasn't even happened and has patiently been waiting for them to make the offer. He is a gem.

&#x200B;

Unbeknownst to him, I've been applying elsewhere for work because I like to have my options open. A job that I would love has shown extreme interest and I'm in my final rounds of interviews tomorrow. I don't have it yet, but there's a chance I will get this offer, and the internal offer at about the same time and I can't help but feel like I'd be screwing over my current boss and the potential new boss if I was to say yes to this other job because they've both put time and effort into securing my position with this internal promotion.

"I'm at a loss; completely bored with IT, how do I even begin moving forward?",56,bjg5j2,"Hey everyone,

I've lurked here for a while and really enjoyed a lot of what I've read, now I think I'm at a stage where I could really use some advice myself.

I'll be brief when describing my background; I'm a 28 year old male living in Australia without a lot of experience with studying outside of high school (barring a Cert IV in Web Design and Dev I got millennia ago). I grew up in a very small town and took the first job I got, which happened to be in IT.

I was young and didn't have much experience at the time, however over the next 8 years I've slowly progressed, moving to the city and working my way into a Junior Engineer role. Not once between many roles do I think I've ever found anything IT interesting in the slightest, and it shows. My strengths have always been in dealing with customers, creating and designing really nice documentation, managing small teams, and providing a strong work ethic.

The thing is, the minute anyone starts talking tech I zone out. It's absolutely boring to me, and it's really gotten to the stage where I'd have to really focus on it to get much more out of this field. I've tried years and years, yet this is the one factor that has never changed.

I don't want to jump forward 10 years and be stuck in some tech job that I hate, if I didn't at least try something new Id never forgive myself.

That's were I'm really hoping to get some input, it honestly seems so overwhelming. There are so many things I'd love to do that I have no idea where to start.

I think about the things I enjoy the most, and they usually fall back to documentation, graphic design, communication and dealing with colleagues/customers. What do I have to go off of from here?

I'm in a good position to maybe study something online or in the evenings??!!

Is this just what the workforce is like? I really hope not, I'd like to think there's at least something I can do.

Any advice would be really really really appreciated.

"Started A New Job In IT, Wanted To See If This Was Normal?",53,aoi3io,"So i started a job in an IT Helpdesk position this week and it has been going, strangely. I wanted to see if this was normal in the work place and in this position.

So I have no prior IT experience other than building my own computers, troubleshooting my own problems, worked at a cellphone carrier before doing technical troubleshooting and a lot of problem solving with phones, and i went to a year long bootcamp and graduated for programming and web development. I guess they liked my problem solving skills, and experience in programming which is why i got the job. Anyways, the company is smaller than small i would say. They have been around since 1990 and their biggest client is a few auto dealerships. In total there are 7 people in the whole company, 2 of them being the owners(brothers).

Anyways, so they aren't training me at all, they give me a list of tasks and i need to complete them by the end of the day. I have no problem with that since with coding its a lot of finding the answer on my own and sink or swim situations aren't new to me. But i feel like im doing a lot more than what my initial position stated. Ive been shadowing too and ill be doing everything from desktop support to imaging computers and deploying them to doing wiring and setting up networks and everything in-between. They had me sign a w4 but no direct deposit, im supposed to work 8am-5pm but i would get here at 7:40 and nobody would show up until 9am. Nobody would call or text me, they havent even given me their phone numbers and they didnt even know mine. One of the employees went out of her way to get me everyones phone number. They agreed to move my time up to 8:30, so ive been getting here at that time and nobody shows up still until 9-9:30. I dont have a key or a code to get in because they wont give me one. They wont even give me the wifi password. ive asked for all of that stuff and they wont give me anything.

Lastly, we are supposed to get reimbursed for our mileage if we drive out to a client, but they dont even track that. I dont even know if they track my time worked because we dont even have a clock in system. It seems very disorganized and i didnt know if this was a normal thing for an IT company?

I'm not trying to bitch and moan i just wanted to see if this was all normal.

EDIT: I have been let go today in my first week because on top of dumping all of these things I had to learn, they expected me to go above and beyond and vacuum the floors and clean the work bench and help carry boxes and said my attitude seemed distant and I explained to them that it’s because this week i have gone through a lot in my personal life and tried to not have it reflect at work. Also because they think they don’t have the time to devote to help me learn like they want so I’ve been let go. ",2019-02-08 18:18:24

Then crickets. So I wait a week and ask her what's up- she says she hasn't heard anything from them. OK cool. I wait a few more weeks and reach out to her again. Still nothing.

Should I keep my job as a permalancer for $34/hour (Fortune 500 company) or accept a full time job for $70k (startup)?,55,9yrtre,"UPDATE: I spoke with my current employer and if seems he won't know until early 2019 if he could add headcount. As it currently stands, he cannot, but he only sees the company and team growing in upcoming years.

.......

Hi Reddit,

Going through a small dilemma here. I was recently offered a position at a startup. I'm currently working as a freelancer at a fortune 500 company.

Some details:
My current position pays me $34/hour. Full time annually that would be $65,280 assuming I work every day. I don't. Even though Im ""permalancing"" of course that means I dont get paid for holidays (such as this week, I have the full week off). I currently dont have health insurance (missed the window where I can sign up) nor do I have a 401k contribution.

The startup offered me a full time position for $70k annually including benefits. This includes insurance, paid time off, 401k contributions, commuter benefits, stipend for health-related costs ($400/year), free meals at work, and cooking classes.

Question is, should I move forward and accept or try to get a full time offer at my current company? I have only been at my current company for a little over a year, and I'm pretty sure the only reason I was considered and offered the position at the startup was because my current company is so well-known.

Any help/guidance would be truly appreciated.

Thanks.

"Should I stay in a miserable job while looking for a new one, or should I quit and try looking after moving to a new city?",54,9sv0dq,"Hello All,

I will try to keep things brief while adequately explaining my situation. Basically, I have been working my first real job out of college for just over a year and a half now. I graduated with a double major in History and Chinese from my university, and found my current job on the other side of the country.

Basically, I work for the American branch of a large state-owned Chinese company on the West Coast. My position is a “Technical Translator”, meaning I’m meant to translate technical documents and provide interpretation. It seemed right up my alley when I started.

Now, I’ve realized I am completely miserable here. If you’ve never worked at a Chinese company before, things tend to be a bit chaotic- very little planning, work way outside of your job description, and generally lots of moments that make you question your sanity. I interned at another Chinese company before so I kind of had an idea of what to expect. It is definitely wearing me down now. I am either spending weeks at a time with literally nothing to do, or I am having periods of crazy overtime and spontaneous cross-country business trips. The atmosphere at work has also become toxic with lots of people moving to other jobs.

Moreover, I am extremely unhappy living here in Southern California. All of my family, who I am very close with, are on the East Coast and everything is crazy expensive here. Don’t get me wrong, it has its merits, but it is NOT for me.

These factors have been wearing down on me so much that I ended up getting diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for the first time. At the beginning of this year, I realized that I needed to go. However, 10 months later I have had no success. This is mainly because I resolved not to quit until I had found a better job.

My strategy has been to look for jobs in the aviation industry, where I work now. However, because my current job is such a niche position, I have seriously been struggling to find jobs I can even realistically apply for. Even then, my biggest handicap has been my liberal arts background. I know majoring in liberal arts was a huge mistake, but I am stuck with it. I thought I could use my experience in the industry, but it has not come out for me at all. Everything wants either engineering or software design backgrounds. I only managed to be interviewed for one job this year, and they told me I was “unconventional” and that most people they hire are engineers, even for non-technical positions. Everything else has been rejection after rejection.

Geographically, I have been applying for jobs only in places I want to live, like back east or in places like Colorado, where I’ve always wanted to live. I'm wondering if it would be better to just quit this job and move somewhere I would want to live. I've read many times that finding a job is much harder when you don't have one already. At the same time, I also wonder if a lot of jobs I apply for don't consider me to be a serious candidate because I live so far away from them. 

My question at this point is, what would be your recommended course of action given my situation? Should I just quit my job and move somewhere I want to live, then look for a job? I have enough savings to live off of for months, but I know it is harder to find a job when you’re unemployed. Should I just suck it up and go back to school for something more technical? Should I just keep sticking it out here until I find something better? For more context, I am relatively young: 24 years old.

I know things should be kept objective here but the emotional part of this situation is just killing me. I am starting to think this niche job is all I can ever be, and I will be stuck here away from my family forever. I am absolutely miserable here but can’t see any escape. I’m hoping I can get a more realistic perspective from the people here.

Thank you for reading, and I apologize for the lengthy post.

Edit: thanks everyone for the variety of viewpoints and advice. I can’t reply to all of them but I can say they are very helpful and will factor tremendously in my decisions moving forward.",2018-10-31 06:04:06
"Hating my master's degree. Completely lost with my career, chose the wrong university degree, how can I remedy things?",55,9qz3k9,"UK. 

I have had a crazy few years. I studied Psychology at University after being really passionate about it during A-Levels. I was interested in Mental Health and was motivated to become a Clinical Psychologist. I knew that I wanted to do some travelling as well so I got a job as a Support Worker with children with learning difficulties to get some Clinical Experience before travelling. 


A year later, I leave my job and travel to Australia alone. But I get into a relationship before I leave. Why? Well I'm stupid and fell in love. Anyways, so I travel and come home after 5 months and decide to start working on my career again. Every possibility goes through my head. 


I finally decide to go back to studying so I can eventually become a Clinical Psychologist hoping that through University I can become re-motivated. 


I'm now a few months into my course and I hate it. Like really hate it. It's a really good uni too. I just feel disillusioned by Clinical Psychology. It's so research based and I'm incredibly bad at stats and anything maths related. 


I've always enjoyed creative things like writing, music and art but I've always kept them as my hobbies because I know how difficult it is to make money off of them but now I'm thinking that my only chance of not being miserable the rest of my life is to pursue something like that. 


I am also really interested in languages, I've started to learn Spanish in my spare time. Also I'm 23 so I have plenty of time for a career change, I just have no clue where to go. 

Any ideas? ",2018-10-24 15:16:18

What the hell should I do?,55,9ea3oq,"I’ll give you the broad strokes and add detail as needed if anyone cares to respond to this.

I’m 35 years old.  I have a wife and two kids (4 yrs and 3 months old).  I currently work around 50 hrs/week as a welder.  I make $45,000/year.  I’m the sole bread winner for the family.  Needless to say, money is tight.  We never go without anything we need, but there’s not a lot left over at the end of the month.

I weld because it’s the only think I’m really qualified to do.  I hate it.  It’s mind numbing and hard on me physically.  

I spent most of my early adulthood in the Army.  
I got out with a pretty nasty case of PTSD.  Out of pride I never really sought treatment, instead I self medicated with alcohol.  In the last five years I was convicted of a DUI and 4 public intoxes.  My credit is shit due to poor drunken decisions.

Almost two years ago I broke down and finally went to a 28 day inpatient treatment center for my alcoholism.  I’ve been sober for almost a year now.

This last year of sobriety has brought me a lot of clarity.  I want better for my family and myself.  I think a big part of that will be to improve our financial situation.  I think in order to accomplish that, I’ll need to change career fields.  What kind of training/schooling/internship can someone in my position undertake that will actually make a difference?  

I’m so lost.  I would walk over hot coals if that’s what it took.  I don’t lack ambition or work ethic, but I lack direction.

What career fields are worth going back to school for?,56,8vlq0f,"So I'm completely lost on what to do with life. Working in an industry I hate, trying to pursue my dream but sadly it's not a stable field so I may never succeed at it.

"Fresh out of college, and one month into my job at a startup, I got an offer from a big company with a 35% jump in pay. Should I be giving any thought to staying?",55,8o30ks,"I recently moved to an entirely new city and accepted a job at a startup that pays $52,500. I’ve been there one month, but a few days ago a company that I had interviewed with previously made me a compelling offer: $64,000 plus a 10% annual bonus. They’ve effectively offered me an $18,000 pay bump. The benefits are better too. 6% match on 401K, compared to no 401K, and 4 weeks PTO, compared to 3. 

This should be an easy decision, especially because I’m in an expensive city. I told the CFO of the startup I’m at my dilemma and he agreed it was a good offer and a tough decision. He reminded me to think about a few factors:

- I’m doing more impactful work at the startup. I’ll likely leave with more significant accomplishments, whereas my work will likely be more routine and smaller in scale at a large company. 
- I want to get an MBA. My boss went to Harvard for his MBA and said I can make a more compelling case for admissions and he will write me a good letter of recommendation to wherever I apply. 
- My current company is growing fast, and he said I would not experience the same growth at a larger company. His assumption was right. The company I have an offer from is likely one you’ve all heard of, but it reported a small loss last year. 
- Industry is an important consideration, as well as long term career goals. This isn’t a point in either column, really. I’m working at an e-commerce startup and have an offer from an insurance company. Neither is necessarily super compelling to me. 

Anyway, the CFO told me that lower pay at a startup is a given which I accept. He also told me he would come back to me with a counter on Monday, but that he will likely be unable to match the full compensation package. 

One of my biggest doubts about my current employer is how much they value me. They initially offered me 46K and I pushed hard to get to 52.5K. I’m again pushing them to match a company that values my talent at $25K more than my current employer initially did. I wonder what this signifies going forward. Will top performance only result in modest pay increases?

I’m also trying to figure out what position better prepares me for applying to business school, or moving to another company or job before that if need be. I have a hunch that being an analyst at a large name brand company gives me flexibility. Whereas doing the same sort of work at an e-commerce startup is more likely to restrict my movement to another industry. 

Anyway, thanks for reading through this wall of text. Any feedback or input would be greatly appreciated. ",2018-06-02 22:37:21
Burned Bridge after working for employer for a year and a half. What to say in future interviews?,51,bl6f1c,"As the title reads, I unfortunately lost my cool and quit my job on the spot after being with them for a year and a half. I've never done this before and consider myself a good reliable, employee but for some reason I found myself walking out of this service job.

To provide some context I graduated 2 years ago from a decent school with a degree in Marketing and was unhappy with the job prospects out of school. Without finding anything permanent, I ended up working a service job in the beverage industry and began to enjoy it over time. It was a cool, hip spot and I felt like I fit in with the culture. I ended up making my way into the manager role which was a welcome promotion but still left me deeply unsatisfied. I appreciated the experience and the responsibility it taught me but it still did not feel right and left me yearning for more. I also live in an area that is extremely slow in the off-season and has a huge rush in the summer months, so the winter months left me with little to do. Also the work environment became horrible over time. I realized my co-workers were extremely bad people and it began to effect me over time, mainly my mental health. I was treated so, so poorly by coworkers on countless occasions. I'd rather not get into specifics but I needed to get out of this small town bubble.

Because of my dissatisfaction, I decided to look for housing and work closer to my circle of friends where we attended our undergrad. I fell in love with that area and wanted desperately to go back. So I let my work know months advance that I had begun looking for housing and work and gave them a rough timeline of how things would play out. It's a tiny business and we are all pretty friendly for the most part so I thought this was just a normal conversation. Turns out they demoted me of my position and cut my hours drastically after hearing word of my notice. This meant loss of the few benefits I had and much, much lower pay after being there for a year. My time was cut in half. Not to mention the work environment had become worse than ever. I am currently down 10 pounds my normal weight and it's taken a noticeable toll. In hindsight, I should have never given my notice to the company but I thought it was the genuine right thing to do so they would be in the best shape come the busy summer months.

So the other day I decided that my life is too short to be miss-treated like this so I walked out. I explained to my boss the situation and they are not happy whatsoever. Luckily, I have plenty of savings by living at home, have had many job interviews (sales/marketing) in the area and will be moving in mid-July.

But for now I am 23, unemployed, and have a feeling of guilt that I can't shake. I feel worse than before. I'm disappointed that after all that time I burned a bridge and acted poorly. I'm also worried that this will hurt me in future interviews. I'm just hoping for some general advice and different opinions on this situation. I know I screwed up.",2019-05-06 05:34:54
"I hate my job, is it worth pursuing meaningful work again?",56,bgfe68,"I work for a high end sales company in a really beautiful location which I initially thought was the perfect job. It's been about half a year now of working there and I have begun to detest it so much. I am trying to gain clarity on my next move. Here are the reasons. 

1. You get talked down to and shouted by rich people almost everyday, which is incredibly frustrating especially when you're from a poor background.
2. The business in general is very discriminatory. They only hire white, attractive people (usually females) for customer facing work. Whereas anyone of colour - or anyone who doesn't fit into this category is hidden away - which is something I hate being a part of.
3. The company's customer care is incredibly poor. You essentially have to ask for contributions from the customers if something goes wrong which is very awkward and you get a lot of abuse for it. The business is only about money and it is glaringly obvious. I do realise this is what business is all about. However, I am not money orientated and is draining me to the core.

I started this job because I wanted to open an ethical clothing chain - because I hate fast-fashion and I thought it would be good to get more of an insight into business. However, I'm starting to think that business is not the right path for me.

Would you leave your cushy corporate director of sales job for a cannabis sales position?,56,acnnn7,"I’ll try to keep this brief...

I am a Senior Director of Sales working for a company in a specialty industry. I started working for this company 10 years ago when they were a start up.  I have a been an impact player for them and they have taken very good care of me. We recently sold to a huge company. I am in a prime position on the growth sector of the business. All in all, things are good with the exception of the impending changes coming from the accusations. 

In September I was approached by a cannabis company looking to expand their product offerings in the specialty industry that I am highly skilled and networked in. I would come in as a Vice President of the channel. I would be responsible for building and executing the business plan. The whole company is very much in start up phase. Start up and scaling business is what I know. In my 10 years I have opened 8,500 Retail doors. 

I’ve done my homework. Spent hundreds of dollars to talk with professionals in the space i.e lawyers and industry god fathers. 

I interviewed, they liked me a lot but I told them in November that the timing wasn’t right. Recently they came back and said they would like to keep the conversation going. Saying they believe they can make me very happy. 

Looking for input on this alternative space and how you’d look at leaving a corporate position for something like this. My main ask is going to be equity. 

Where do you see the Cannabis industry going and would you see it as a huge opportunity to get in on the ground floor or no different that any other start up company? 

About me- mid 30’s. Family that I support. No debt outside of a $1,000 mortgage and I have enough in the bank to pay that off and still have plenty to lean back on. Good retirement built up as well. Wife had a job that could support us if needed based on our low level of expenses.

"What are some decent-paying jobs that involve ""creating"" and working from home or anywhere you want (mobile)?",54,9u1q5t,"I recently graduated from uni and realized what I did was not was I wanted. I have a degree in food science and work in food industries in quality assurance. Food is interesting, but this kind of work is not. It's tedious and routine, I need to change shifts from morning to evening and back every couple weeks, which really affects my sleep schedule, the pay isn't all that great either, and to be honest, I don't even like science that much in the first place. At least not tedious work like this. 90% of graduates end up doing this kind of work. I figured, if I better change to something while I'm young now or I'll end up stuck doing this forever.

I've been wanting to do a career change and came up with a few points that I would really want in a job. I don't know what kind of jobs to look for or what to go back to learn for, but I hope someone may have an idea:

* I think I would enjoy doing a creative sort of job. Anything that allows me to ""create"" something would satisfy me I think. However, the last two points are far more important to me. If there is no such job that can satisfy all three, then the last two would do fine if possible.

* I hate the idea of being controlled by your job to move to where you find work, so I would like a mobile job that can be done working from home, or anywhere else. I assume, working on something that involves a computer, or at least a job that is fine with you being anywhere as long as you are able to connect with the employer through phone or computer.

* Lastly, a decent pay, or something that can work up to a decent pay. I was lead to believe that creative jobs don't pay well in school, which was what led me into going into the sciences. I obviously need to still support myself and have something that can give me a decent amount of money to save up and use for certain goals.",2018-11-04 09:35:05
"35 with no real marketable skills, how to get started?",54,9n1rt5,"I made a lot of poor career decisions early in my adult life and have just realized recently that I have no real career path or marketable skills, and I'm really starting to worry that I will die deep in debt with nothing to show for it.  I'm hoping for some suggestions on how I can build some skills and actually start a real career so that I can maybe retire one day.

Back story:
I went to college right out of high school and had to pay my own way.  I worked throughout college just to pay for necessities but still had to take out lots of loans to pay for tuition and books, and I'm at the point where I don't think I will realistically ever be able to pay off that debt.

When I was in school for history, I worked at the college doing general IT stuff (desktop support mostly) which was actually a lot better for getting jobs than my degree.  Since college, I worked at a company running sound for concerts and corporate events, but then got a job working phone tech support for my local ISP.  Did that for a couple of years, then traded up to a job doing support for a Microsoft vendor company only to have my entire team laid off and outsourced to another country after another couple of years there.

I was without a full time job for about a year, but was able to stay afloat running sound in a freelance capacity.  I was eventually able to get another IT job doing the same kinds of general stuff that I was doing while I was in college over 10 years ago, but they keep me part time so that they don't have to pay me any benefits (it's a state job).

I have pretty much divided my professional time between running sound (if you can actually find work in my area doing that, it pays minimum wage, and people don't even want to pay you that) and doing very general IT stuff that doesn't require a lot of specific knowledge.  I'm now 35 and not sure where to go from here... I have nothing saved for retirement, and my credit card bills are adding up.  I keep applying for jobs but rarely get an interview, and out of those I never get a job offer.  I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm not an idiot either.  I can learn almost anything I set my mind to, but most people my age have a specific skillset that they have honed by now that will get them good paying jobs, and I'm still basically doing entry level work.

A co-worker called me unprofessional and insulted my intelligence. What do I do and how do I feel confident tomorrow?,52,8yfw56,"I am a recent university grad and I'm currently working at an office for a summer job before I start my post-grad in the fall. The majority of my team is in their 40s, and they often talk about their young kids and since starting I've found it hard to relate to them. They have placed in a cubicle far away from where everyone else sits, so it's made it more difficult for me to get to know them. Despite this, I've been pretty friendly.

Over the past few weeks, I've had a strong feeling that my co-workers have talked about me behind my back. Usually when I leave after asking them a question I hear them whispering. As an intern, I've also received very minimal work and I usually do one task a day or spend the day refreshing my email. When I ask if anything needs to be done, they say there's nothing I can do to help. Today, one of my co-workers gave a filing task. She didn't really explain what the files were. I arranged the files and put them in a folder not thinking much of it. About 30 minutes later she comes up to me, saying that my work looked unprofessional and that if I need help with filing and stapling things together to ask the receptionist because the receptionist is actually good at filing and completing the task. I think she could tell from my facial expressions that this comment hurt me, so she said it again.

For the last hour of the day, I felt really shitty. I felt really stupid as well. Earlier in the day before the incident happened, the same coworker asked me to email her a document, which I did, however she did not receive it. She made another co-worker watch me re-send the email to make sure I was ""doing it correctly"" (really? you don't think I can send an email correctly?) and for some odd reason the email went through.

I'm feeling a bit crappy about myself and my capabilities. At this point I'm a bit nervous about asking my co-workers for work/things to do because it feels like they think I'm stupid or socially inept. A lot of the tasks are so menial, so it feels like I can't even ""show"" them that I'm smart or a hard worker.

I've been thinking of some paths but I realised that nothing really interests me deeply. I don't want to choose a career based solely on income. I don't want to feel miserable for the rest of my working life, either.

Stay with entry level high pay job or take slightly different job out of my realm of experience for less pay but potentially better future?,55,bfmwev,"Background: 25M with associates degree working at first job still from college. Moved from city to small town working swing shifts. 

I'm currently working as a maintenance technician for large company. I just run around all day working on pretty minimal tasks. I know I'm not getting the experience I wanted and doing more basic mechanical work vs electrical which I went to school for. I've been here for four years and that's because of how much they are paying me. Trying to get a more mid level position is tough because jobs internally are all seniority based. I feel like I am losing touch with my skills from school. I'm looking at different jobs in bigger cities. Currently jobs like engineering techs that have a specific task or project sound more interesting, would keep me focused and better for career advancement I feel. One problem is some of my experience doesn't match up.
    My question is has someone walked down a similar path as I (or even not) and have advice on what to do? I just feel a bit beaten down and already sick of this career from my experience so far. I know it's my first job and there could be better jobs out there.

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone. My current goal now is find out if there is any possible growth for me at my current job, while applying for positions I'm interested elsewhere. There is only one way to find out more about a company and that is apply. Worst that happens is I don't hear back.",2019-04-21 11:50:28

Over 200 job applications and still going.... When will it end?,53,ayh0sm,"In the last 3 months I've submitted over 200 applications and have received 6 interviews, 10 rejections and one awful job offer but mostly complete silence. My days mostly consist of delivering food to make rent and learning/getting better at some computer skills. I'm an extremely motivated person but my enthusiasm is beginning to waiver. 

I keep telling myself im super qualified and I have excellent skills. Recruiters call and tell me the same thing. I've gotten really good at interviews and now leave feeling really good. There's just one big problem. I live in the middle of nowhere. 

There's almost no employment in my line of work (biotech) where I live. As a result I am searching out of state. It's honestly very difficult for me to keep my positivity up. Further more it's getting harder to find companies/positions I haven't applied for.

 I wish I could tell you that I just used the ""spray and pray"" method, didn't put thought into my cover letter, didn't use keywords in my  resume or there was some other fault in my process but honestly I have done a lot of research and had a lot of professionals observe and approve my methodology. Yet despite this no success. And now money/debt is becoming a huge concern

I feel like I'm in a black hole both mentally and in my physical location. 

How exactly do you keep your spirits up? I feel completely powerless to do anything to fix my situation. I feel like everything I've accomplished, my degrees, my certifications in the end are just complete bullshit.

"Workplace has chosen to ""demote"" me before a new position started after filing a grievance. Seems to be a disguised punitive response. Any suggestions?",53,8pg7hb,"There is a TL;DR at the end, but it is also somewhat long. Summarizing doesn't seem to be one of my strong suits so I am sorry.

So last month I had an insane stint at work when the kitchen at our elderly care facility had to be shut down. Days were 2\-6 hours longer than months for about 3 weeks, some of the weeks nearing 80 hours as we had to create and implement odd workarounds to keeping the residents well fed and happy. The job I currently have is a casual gig that I kept while in school because it worked to keep my resume active. It is somewhat feast or famine like this, but this stint was exceptionally hard.

I was underpaid, on many accounts, but the most idiotic one to me was the fact that they didn't want to pay me for my breaks that i didn't get a chance to take. In 16 shifts, I took 1 hour and 20 minutes of break, and as per our collective agreement, I am entitled a half hour paid break. When I saw that my payment was short, I brought this up with management who said that it was ""my choice,"" and that they couldn't pay me for time I wasn't there, which is idiotic considering I really did save them from literal disaster as they were heavily short staffed during the reno, and for another I could have very easily stayed after my shift for a half an hour and taken a break then. The implication was that the break was at the end of my shift. And after already staying a few hours past 8 with no break, it doesn't seem fair to ask someone to stay longer to take their break on site.

The manager offered me a part time weekend job on Concierge that she needed to fill immediately, that I had also been asking for as it at least had some relevant skills to my degree, but it was clear it was partly because she felt bad for drastically underpaying me for labour rendered. I accepted it, meanwhile wholly intending to still write a grievance as when someone owes you more than $500, you can't let that go.

The grievance essentially asked for the pay for my paid breaks, mileage for extra driving to other facilities as was necessary, a higher pay grade as the job I was doing was not the job that I have been doing at the facility until now, and overtime for a 6th and 7th consecutive day of work, which is part of our collective agreement. This would have roughly come up to around 200\+100\+385\+170= $825.

The union rep highly suggested I submit as it wasn't as if I was doing anything illegal, just asking for remuneration for an insane stint of work where I essentially kept the operation afloat. Literally every staff member there during the renovation spoke highly of me for my effort during, as my hard work was very apparent. The union rep emailed her my grievance and asked to have a meeting with her before he submitted it to the union.

Today I had my 5th day of training for my concierge job. By all accounts, I have been doing just as well as anyone else. Frankly, many of the residents have expressed how well liked I was in the position. Not only that, the concierge staff training me have also expressed that I was as good as anyone in that role. I was supposed to start myself this weekend. Unfortunately the manager and assistant manager called me into their office and said they weren't comfortable offering me the position now as I didn't seem ready. When pressed for reasons, they gave flaky, incomplete answers. Either way, even if there were tiny mistakes, which there weren't, those should be expected during a training period. They, rather nonsensically, said they were still committed to my development.

This was, I believe, a disguised punitive response to attempting to file a grievance. When I called my union rep about it, he was furious, and immediately emailed that he was going to file an unfair treatment by management grievance with me now.

Honestly, at this point I plan to maliciously comply if I can, because fuck them. I haven't been fired (as I am at this point the casual of all departments, and I've done nothing that anyone can really complain about), so technically any shifts that are on the schedule currently, which are the next 4 weekends are still mine if I want to come in. Or so it is if my understanding is correct. So I think They will just have to keep a concierge staff there that is ""ready"" if that's the case, costing them double. Also, they have put in a ""resident newsletter"" that I was already hired for the position. If that counts as official documentation for that, without strong cause, I feel like I might have a case to take them to task.

Does anyone have any strong suggestions to what I should be doing? Am I doing anything wrong? It really is upsetting that when you give a place your literal best, they treat you poorly. I really need to start the proper job search now that I'm done university.

TL;DR I worked during a crazy period at my work where I was grossly underpaid. Management felt bad, but not bad enough to actually pay me for my efforts, and offered me a part time job in a position I still wanted. I didn't take this as figurative hush money and was still completely planning on filing a grievance with my union as I still would have to work like almost 5 weekends to make back what they owed me. Did 5 training shifts and literally the day after my union rep emailed my manager about my concerns to have a preliminary meeting before filing the grievance, my manager and assistant manager ambushed me with a meeting essentially saying I wasn't a proper fit for the job right now, with pretty much every indication, and a goddamn college diploma and university degree to the contrary. This seems punitive. Not technically fired though, so I plan on still showing up on the already scheduled shifts, and filing additional paperwork with the union anyways because fuck employers that take advantage of their employees. Union rep also wishes to file paperwork regarding poor treatment by management. I was curious if a resident newsletter which said I would be the new person in the concierge position could be used to say that I have already been hired as concierge and that I should have union protection in the position. Thoughts and suggestions?

...That TL;DR may still be TL but whatever man. Thank you so much if you've read to the end. Let me know what you think. Thanks!",2018-06-08 05:20:19
How do you break into project management?,53,byw1gh,"Hey everyone, this may a bit of a ramble but I'm just looking for pointers.

I quit my job on Friday. I was given an ultimatum of looking after my infant daughter who had chicken pox for a few days or keeping my job.  I know I could take the whole thing to tribunal but I have had enough with the company and decided to leave on my own terms.

I had a bit of a mixed role. My title was estimator, but in reality I was running my own department estimating and coordinating stone masonry projects all over London. There was a lot more scheduling, meeting with clients, checking progress and reevaluation of projects going on for a typical estimating role. After looking into project management and what it entails I am fairly certain that is what I have been doing all along under a different title.

My question is, without 'project manager' on my CV how would I go about getting into that?  I am also hoping to step away from construction as although I am competent in it I have lost my interest in the sector. Which leads to my next hurdle. How would I go about breaking into project management in a marketing or digital agency where my interests currently lie?

I am mute with high-functioning autism and PTSD. Is there any work available for me?,52,blvn01,"For some background, I am a 20 year old girl with autism and PTSD and I am unable to speak. I live with my mother and three younger sisters. It is getting harder for my mother to support us and I need a job for myself at some point or I'm going to end up homeless or hopefully dead within a few years at most. I have a few items I could possibly sell online that could maybe pay for a couple semesters of college with fafsa funds but that's all for college.

&#x200B;

I live in a fairly small town and have applied to almost every entry-level job open that I could find within about an hour commute by bus. I tried to focus on jobs that I thought would have the least interaction with people but I still applied to the others because I'm desperate. A few of them interviewed me because for an entry level job I look ok on my resume, but every one ended poorly and I wasn't even able to complete one of them due to my communication issues.

&#x200B;

Probably my best chance was a job as a hotel housekeeper and the one I applied to was even one of the few that interviewed me but they didn't respond to me or even tell me no, I had to email them later to ask if they had decided.

&#x200B;

The other job I thought I could do was work as a librarian but I am very confused how you can or if it's even possible to directly apply to that job. And I'm guessing that it's most likely a highly contested job already or one that rarely has open positions so I have no chance if so.

  
I've also tried looking for the ""online jobs"" like chat support or data entry. I have looked at so many different possible online jobs and they seem to be so highly contested that they might as well not exist because I have not found almost a single one that I could apply to. I just get spammed with survey sites and things like that.

&#x200B;

I am also very small and weak and I wouldn't be hired for a physical labor type of job.

&#x200B;

I wish more than anything I could just be given a chance by someone because I have a very good work ethic and dedication and could more than prove myself in a job, I just have issues that mean I can't do almost any entry-level job requiring much interaction with people.

Management wants to transfer me to salary. Should my salary be equivalent of my 40 hour work week?,53,9lmgne,"Hi! Not sure I am asking in the correct subreddit, if I am not I apologize. I posted in /r/askHR thought I would post here as well.

I am located in FL.

My employer wants to convert me from hourly wage to a weekly salary. Basically what they're doing is converting my equivalent of 40 hours to a salary. So if I make $25 an hour @40 hours a week, they're going to convert me to a salary of $1000.

&nbsp;
My job entails I work more than 40 hours a week. I work anywhere from 45-50 hours each week. I do not get paid overtime but I get paid for the additional hours worked since I am hourly based. Upper Management wants to cut back on my hours and set me at 40 hours a week on salary with a small raise. The small raise is not due to my shift to salary. The Manager told me I should expect to work the extra hours with no additional compensation.

Converting me to salary doesn't seem as much of a raise as I am now being set to a salary while expected to continue to work my 45-50 hour work week. If I know I am going to consistently be working 45-50 hours a week should I ask to be kept hourly? I feel like I am being dicked around and they're just trying to save money by cutting my hours and switching me to salary while getting me to work 45-50 hours for less pay.

"My friend at work is going to get fired in a month, but he doesn't have a clue. Should I tell him?",55,88bc5s,"He's 45 with two kids. One is graduating high school this year, and the other is in junior high. His wife works (very) part-time so he is the main bread winner in the family. I used to share an office with him so he and I became fairly close until I moved out a few months ago to a different office.

A new girl was recently hired and took my old desk. She and I became friends pretty quickly, and now she is telling me some of the things the president and general manager are telling her. It's not looking good for him. They're planning on bringing in someone new to replace him 4-6 weeks from now.

Honestly, I can see why. He's in a different sales department than me, but I sensed some lazy and erratic behavior with his customers before I moved offices. He doesn't seem focused, and if I were a manager, I would probably come to the same conclusion. According to the new girl, the president and manager of the company have already decided it's too late for my friend.

If I were him, I would want to know that I should be looking for a new job. Judging by his circumstances, I don't think there's any way he's financially stable enough to support his family when he loses this job. 4-6 weeks would be a nice jump-start on figuring out what to do when it happens.

The problem is... I'm not sure if I should risk creating drama in the department. The reason they are keeping him for 4-6 more weeks is because he is working on training the new girl. If he learns that they are going to can him now, he may leave right away, which puts the company in a bad position. If that happens AND they learn that I gave him the heads up, that will look bad on me and potentially the new girl (if they assume she clued me in). All my information is from her, except I did have a bad feeling before I left the office.

How do you think I should go about this? It would be tough to tell him to look for a new job without any hard reasons about why he should. I know that it's exactly 4-6 weeks, but the only reason I know that is because of the new girl. How do I tell him that information without creating a shit storm?

I have a very sought-after skillset with a lot of strong experience but can't seem to attract attention from overseas employers. How to convince an international employer I'm worth the visa process?,48,bm66lv,"First off - I appreciate any help or advice you can give. This is a great subreddit.  I'll try to be as objective as possible about my situation, forgive me if it comes off slightly conceited, I just want to be clear about why I'm a bit frustrated/down on the process.

&#x200B;

My Situation:

&#x200B;

I'm a senior cybersecurity engineer at a major bank in the United States.  I've led engineering teams in 5 different Fortune 100 companies, most of whom are in financial services or telecommunications.  I generally specialize in applied cryptography/encryption and data protection (data loss prevention, data classification, DRM, etc); but I've essentially touched every aspect of cybersecurity, including building out one of the larger and more advanced Threat Intelligence and Malware Analysis platforms in the world (to my knowledge, anyway).  I helped design the encryption/tokenization scheme for a major cashless payment app that everyone in the world has heard of. I could go on, but my point is - I have some incredibly strong qualifications in Cybersecurity.

&#x200B;

My partner and I have been wanting to leave the US and try the 'expat thing.' I want more international experience (while working for the Big Four as a senior cybersec consultant I traveled pretty extensively to Asia and Europe but I've never lived outside the US) and exposure to business cultures other than my own, among other reasons.

&#x200B;

I've not had much luck. In the US if I submit a resume (to an open req I'm qualified for) it's rare that I don't at least get an interview.  However I've submitted dozens of applications to roles in the UK and Western Europe that I'm either qualified or totally OVERQUALIFIED to hold, but I'll usually get a reply within 12-24 hours saying I ""don't have the skills they require.""  Which to be totally frank... I just don't buy - at all.  And I don't mean to say there's no job I'm not qualified for - but I've literally applied to roles which I've ALREADY HELD AT THE SAME COMPANY (but the US branch/firm) and was an extremely high performer, which would've been in their HR records if they bothered to look (I let them know on the application I'd already worked for the company, as this was a question on the app).

&#x200B;

I have a few possibilities on the table because I have a decently strong network, even in Europe.  But even with a foot in the door it's been difficult to get a company to consider me at all. I imagine a lot of this could be due to issues in the EU and UK (i.e. Brexit) that are making immigration difficult.

&#x200B;

I've mainly focused on Western Europe because my language skills are lacking - I can speak some very basic Mandarin and elementary Spanish, but not enough to function well in a business environment.  That said, I'm open to most places, I've also found some interesting roles in Singapore and Dubai, for instance.

&#x200B;

The Question:

&#x200B;

What gives? Am I being unrealistic about my skillset? I know cybersecurity is a hot industry and at least in the US we don't have even close to the number of skilled employees we need to fill the roles we have.  I'm guessing Europe is likely in a similar, or worse, boat. How do I appear more attractive to employers overseas? Or will I always get a rejection in 24 hours regardless of my skills, simply because I checked ""I do not currently have the right to work in the UK and would need sponsorship?"" Do I need to wait out Brexit first (at least in regard to the UK)?

&#x200B;

I'd really appreciate any advice you have on anything from: resources I may not be aware of to find jobs outside the US, any insight into the hiring process you may have, advice on companies or industries that tend to be more likely to hire foreigners, etc.  Feel free to message me directly if you don't feel comfortable replying to the post, for whatever reason.

I have very little marketable skills and have been stuck in a dead end security job for 4 years making 30k. Im trying to get into anything making over 40k. Is there anything i can do within a year or two do achieve that?,48,9kthb3,"Hello. Like title says ive been working security at a high rise building about 4 years now. I like my job very much as its very exciting and allows me to be around high profile individuals on a daily basis.the problem is that it is very far away from home and i have 2 children and a wife i provide for. Even though i have an early morning shift i do not get back home until around 5 p.m. because of the commute. I have been relying on getting luck and landing a job by just having  positive relations with the buisness owners of the building i work at. I have come very close but the oportunities never fully come through unfortunately. I feel as though i am being very naive by hoping i could get an office job because im extra nice to specific vips of my building and would like to be more proactive in taking my future into my own hands. I would be fine doing most things as long as i get paid well and could do schooling online but would be limited to one or 2 classes at a time due to my busy lifestyle with work and children. I have some administrative assistant experience with helping my wife manage her buisness and as stated i have experience with high rise building security in a high profile neighborhood. I have no specific direction or interests other than i know i need to make more money as i am living paycheck to paycheck. Most of my employers have praised my customer service skills and i believe i do well in interviews. I have hobbies and interests but to turn any of them into a job is too risky as there are people dependant on me for an income. I'm sorry for the increadibly disorganized rant. I just feel as though i already wasted my prime years (im in my very late 20's) of getting a real career established and now my main goal is just to be able to support my family. Thank you very much for your time.

Edit: a very important detail i left out is i have a disability which on flare up days can limit my ability to perform strenuous physical activity and my job works with my disability as it is mostly desk work",2018-10-02 21:56:46

And a resounding ""work on your confidence"" from the crowd. Thank you for the responses!

The below is probably too wordy, but I included my job history with how those relationships went to see if it helps point out a pattern. I'm fine with tough love - I'm the first in my immediate family to even navigate this far in the career world so I need it - what am I not seeing? My twenties are over, I don't want sugar coated ""follow your heart, it will all work out"" suggestions anymore. 

--
**Here's the job history - not including college and before since I don't include that on my resume:**

--Job 1: Right out of college, I worked in the restaurant industry in a new city for two years while also doing internships, retail jobs and unpaid assistant work to try my hand at a creative field. Due to funds and two-years of being around thousands of other people just like me who were decades older and no farther in their 'dream', I decided to go back to my college town after a brief three-month stint of unemployment while in my hometown due to family matters.  

--Job 2: (Client Services & Admin) I got my first salaried job after about a month of looking and accepted after interviewing twice with three different departments of a large corporate company. I was offered all three positions but chose the one with a team I really respected and felt I connected with on a personal level and because the role was more client-focused instead of sales-focused. The company was great - it had continuing ed resources, motivated & intelligent staff, a large outfitted office, and a variety of departments that offered a lot of career potential. I made great connections. I used my free time, manager approved, to interview people from other departments so I could make connections and I worked with their community service department on top of that. I had great reviews and studied informally with their head ops manager with higher level employees so I could learn more advanced tools. At three months, I was given the opp to interview for a specialized position with one of their CMS tools - providing support for internal staff - but was advised not to apply by my team's VP and my other mentors since I was still so new and hadn't proven myself. Shortly after, our department restructured and then restructured again almost immediately after. Our teams were juggled, jobs were changed, and I was suddenly in a lessened role with a group of strangers (VP to associate level) who were all suddenly doing more work of a lesser level than they were used to. Needless to say, my entire team quit within six months because most internal roles were suddenly frozen and we were expected to see the restructure through with no increase in pay but a tremendous increase in hours. It got pretty ugly and chaotic, but I left on good terms with a seemingly great group of references and mentors. 

--Job 3: (Business Dev & Admin) I got a business dev job within a week via a reputable recruiter a colleague had suggested. I interviewed three times - once with the recruiter and twice with the company. It felt polished and thoughtful, my future boss was charismatic and the job seemed more focused on social good than my previous job. On top of that, despite having a piss poor website, the company was in a great building and was the pet project of a well-established company run by a motivated and effervescent CEO. I'd be using what I'd learned in my previous job to help shape their organization and provide more thoughtful client support as well as doing some sales - but I felt that the product which made sense in my interviews was worth the sale. Needless, it wasn't and I was a fool for being tricked. My boss was fired within three weeks of me starting though she was paid in some bizarre way as a consultant because the CEO felt bad and I was left with no department but myself and drawers full of exercise equipment and no client or sales history and a product that was great in a pitch but had no practical application. The stress of that job ended up with me in the hospital which was cool after one too many late nights and Saturdays in the office (thought things like that were jokes, but they're not). I left after three months, staying on only to complete a fundraiser with a third party company that I enjoyed working with. I cited health problems as my reason because I didn't want to screw over the company because I do think they meant well, they just were a hateful bunch who got paid well to sell nothing and sabotaged each other's products - it was a confusing place. During this time, I applied for a handful of open positions back at job #2 but nothing got past a second interview. 

--Job 4 (Operations & Admin): My latest job - I thought this was my holy grail. I was connected with the CEO via a mentor from job #2. It was a new company with a lot of potential and tied into everything I'd been doing at all my other jobs. It seemed like a great fit on paper, and I'd be employee number one - learning how a company gets built from the ground up and hopefully making a positive impact on that growth. I didn't jump right away. I interviewed with the CEO across the span of a few weeks - meeting people we'd be contracting, learning various plans for the company, going over whether or not we could work well together. I did all of this while still at #3, on weekends and evenings when I wasn't fixing some mistake at the old job. Point is, I tried to make sure I was making a good decision and I figured if I was ever going to try something like this, it would be in my twenties when I still had the energy and few responsibilities. I started a day after leaving #3 which was fine because it was exciting. It was rough in reality, which I expected. I wore a lot of hats, took on a lot of stress, and at my three-month review was told I had no ego and was a yes-man because my boss liked arguing more than deliberating and I'm the exact opposite. We had a lot of crossed wires, a lot of emotion, but the company had business and I had a paycheck and it was a unique way to live for almost two years. I have a lot of feelings about that boss, but I don't know how many of them are actually helpful. Essentially, a few months shy of my two year anniversary with no benefits and no pay increase, I was called in for a meeting. My boss seemed happy which was not normal and had only ever coincided with cool updates on the business, so I was excited. We had new employees and had just moved two 'exec's to unpaid contract work, so I was thinking this was a promotion - increased responsibility, increased pay. But it wasn't - my boss wanted me to stay but I'd have to be a truck driver for an unknown amount of time until they could get more funding figured out. The new employees, they weren't staying. So, I asked for three days and quit the following morning. All of the employees were fired or quit over the next six months. While my boss wrote letters for me saying I was laid off, I wasn't paid a severance like the others because I screwed myself by technically quitting. I moved back to my hometown because I had nowhere else to go. In the past year, my previous role has been brought back and filled.


**My Red Flags:**

--I've lived in three different cities in ten years and the longest job I've had has been for just shy of two years. I moved to my current area for job prospects. It is incredibly far from my hometown (hours by plane) - the question of why I moved so far from family has come up which is why I bring it up. I was an English major. 

--While I come off as poised and dependable (from peer/manager reviews), I have also been told I'm ""quiet and meek"". 

--I'm a pushover. I hate to admit this, but I think it's become obvious. If someone says that I'll be valuable and help them, I try to make it work until it can't anymore and I'm left with no other options and the other person has gotten their low-level support. 

--I don't upsell myself. I'm terrible at it. I'm good at interviewing and conversation, but not lying. I feel uncomfortable with my job history and it shows. 

--I have good references but I haven't spoken to them in a year because I'm embarrassed. I know I need to get over this, but they all are related to job #4's boss and I feel ashamed at not finding something new after being consistently employed for so long. 

**Where I don't know how to proceed:**

--Obviously, I am doing something wrong. Am I not asking the right questions in interviews? Am I not sticking through the bumps long enough? Am I not leaving soon enough? Am I picking mentors terribly? Now, that I'm in a new city, I want to make sure I'm building a foundation that won't implode. My college's career counseling services left a lot to be desired, so I'm hoping you all can help! 

Thank you in advance! Edited for formatting.",2018-06-19 14:49:30
What is the Proper Way to Resign?,51,8kcoac,"# Tips For a Smooth Resignation

The decision to resign from a job is not always an easy one. Maybe you received a better job offer. Perhaps you are not being fulfilled in your current position. Or maybe you are just ready for a change. Regardless of the reason, the resignation process can be daunting, and employees who do not handle it appropriately can damage valuable professional relationships that would otherwise help their career.

So how do you quit your job and ensure a smooth transition for you and your employer?

## 1. Be certain you have a formal written offer in hand that has been officially accepted with a confirmed compensation package and start date.

While it may seem obvious, this is extremely important. Imagine submitting a resignation letter to your current employer under the assumption that you will be starting a position with a new company in two weeks only to find out you do not have a job? It happens! There are a number of technicalities that can hinder a company from moving forward with a job offer. For instance, some offers are contingent upon other factors such as results from drug screenings, background checks, and reference checks. And while it is easy to dismiss any concerns towards these contingencies if your life has been on the straight and narrow, you should consider the following:

* Some companies will exclude you if you are found using certain prescription medications.
* Background checks can include credit checks, and a low credit score can \(in some states\) be grounds for losing a job offer, depending upon your status and position.
* Not everyone really likes you. While you may do your best in selecting references who would have nothing but positive feedback to provide about you, people share what they want. And it would be awful to discover a “frenemy” during a job search.

## 2. Have a written resignation letter for submittal with a specific end date.

This is a good practice as it gives both you and the company a strict deadline for tying up any loose ends or pending projects. How much notice should you give when resigning? Two weeks’ notice is the standard minimum, and although not required, it is usually appreciated by employers. Don’t assume you need an extended resignation period. Two weeks provides employers with a sufficient amount of time to consider who your replacement might be while you ensure your work transitions smoothly. It also protects you from having to work longer than anticipated. Remember, all SMART \(specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, & time\-bound\) goals have deadlines, and when quitting your job, it becomes one of them.

## 3. Be prepared for a counteroffer.

When submitting a resignation letter, you should always be prepared for your employer to make an effort to get you to stay. Take time to really consider ahead of time your reasons for leaving the company, whether that be an inadequate salary, poor benefit plans, lack of work\-life balance, etc. Knowing your why will keep you on track in the event that a counter offer is made. If you are satisfied with your pay but are leaving due to the poor work\-life balance, a 2&#37; raise should not make you question your decision. If your workload is already overwhelming, a raise is not going improve it. On the other hand, if your main motivator for leaving is an inadequate salary, you should consider why you had to resign in order to get a raise. What will it take for you to get your next raise? This ensures that you are not caught off guard at any point during the resignation process and do not absent\-mindedly agree to stay on terms you will later regret.

## 4. Be gracious and professional during your resignation period.

Maintaining professionalism throughout the entire resignation process is essential, no matter how challenging it is. Burning bridges is a bad practice and has the potential to negatively affect your career. Consider that a potential future employer requests to speak with your soon\-to\-be former employer about your work at the company only to receive criticism on how you conducted yourself during your last week. This would surely discourage a company considering you for hire. It is important to remember that regardless of how much of a positive impact you have had on a company, squandering the last two weeks can quickly overwrite that legacy.

Here are a few simple things you can do to maintain professionalism and grace:

* Be polite & smile when appropriate.
* Be patient during the transition as managers can sometimes begin assigning additional projects in a last ditch effort to utilize the company’s most experienced resources.
* If you have already secured a new position, don’t overshare the details. No matter how relaxed the company culture may appear, it is best to remain conservative to prevent any undesirable issues that might affect your new job.

## 5. Schedule at least one lunch or coffee meetup with your future employer during the resignation period.

There’s something about coffee and food that helps build bridges. Grabbing coffee or lunch with your new employer is a great way to start the relationship. It gives the opportunity to have an informal sit\-down out of the office before you become an official office\-mate. And hopefully, the meeting will solidify your decision to begin a new journey in your career.

# Resigning Successfully

The resignation process is full of intricate details throughout, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. Maintaining a high level of professionalism and preparedness can make a huge difference in the outcome. You should always do your best to ensure a smooth transition for both you and your employer. This will leave the company with fond and professional memories of you, and in turn, managers won’t hesitate to recommend you for other opportunities. Always resign with the future in mind. Good Luck!

The CEO of the company I work for threatened to fire me after I told him I would be pursuing another degree in addition to my networking degree. How do I handle this?,48,8igke4,"I work for a small ‘startup’ company (less than 20 people) in the space communications industry. I was brought on as a networking intern. When I was first hired, they promised me that they would be flexible and considerate of my classes, as I am a full-time information systems student. Also, they promised me that they would start me out at low pay ($12/hour), but that it would quickly go up from there.


Also, the company is so small that the CEO also acts as the day-to-day operations manager. So I directly work with him.
Also, some background on myself. I am currently an Information Systems student pursuing an Associates in Computer Network Communications and working towards obtaining my CCNA. Eventually, I’ll continue my education and pursue a Bachelor’s.  Right now, I’m finishing up my 3rd semester and plan on graduating by the end of fall semester this year. 


The first months that I was there went smoothly. To begin, they assigned a small project for me to work on. The work was challenging, but I liked in and I learned a lot, I got along with all of my co-workers, etc. They were also very pleased with my work and decided to start giving me more projects to work on. But after 4 months or so, things started to change. 


After the project ended, I got assigned to other projects. I also started helping out other people with their work as well. Things at work seemed to be progressing well, and I was excited to be there. The CEO told me about an old server that they had that wasn’t being utilized. It sounded like something that would be a great learning experience and that I would have enough of an understanding to at least get it up and working. So I volunteered to help configure it. I quickly realized that I could not do this project on my own, so I asked one of my professors who happens to be a CCNP/network consultant to come in and give us some guidance. Based on what my professor told me and the input that I received from the CEO and other colleagues, I wrote up a plan. Once my plan was finished, I presented it to the to the CEO and he told me that this has already taken us too much time and that going forward with this plan will consume even more time that they can’t afford. I was so confused and frustrated. I will admit that my plan wasn’t perfect and that I could have done better, but it seemed like the CEO had completely made up his mind beforehand to not proceed with the server and then blamed it on me. After the meeting, one of my colleagues let me know that he thought the CEO was being hard on me and that he was being unreasonable, as I was only doing what I was told. I was so confused and disappointed. I started wondering if maybe I made a mistake going into networking.


After this, I became the scapegoat and was called out for every little mistake that I made by the CEO. He would single me out in meetings and embarrass me in front of my co-workers. He claims that it’s not personal and that it’s a normal thing in business. I was reluctant, but I took him at his word and hoped that his criticisms would stop eventually, but it only got worse. I started to dread going to work because I knew that somehow, I would be humiliated or lectured. Every little thing that I would do, set him off. Whenever he would do this, it would ruin my entire day. It feels like he’s just looking for any excuse to criticize me.


While this is going on, I began to explore other educational paths other than networking (possibly because of this experience?) While I enjoy networking, I wasn’t sure if it was something that I wanted to focus on. After lots of research, I realized that I would only take me one more semester to obtain my Associate’s in Web Development after I graduate with my Associate’s in Networking. It seemed like a win-win. I wouldn’t have to go for 2 more years to get a separate degree, but I would also be able to finish up my current degree without extending my graduation date. 


Once I reached this decision, I realized that I needed to take a second class in the summer so that I could take higher-level classes in the fall. When I realized this, I went to the CEO and let him know well in advance (keep in mind, summer classes don’t start for another 3 weeks). When I told him this he blew up. I honestly don’t remember much because my adrenaline was pumping, but this is what I can recall from the conversation.


I walked into the conference room where the CEO and one of my colleagues were working. The conference room leads out to the main office space, which is relatively small compared to most workplaces. So if someone is working in the conference room, you can hear everything that they are saying. I come in and I hand him a draft of a report that I had been working on. While I was there, I let him know that I would be taking a second class over the summer, but that it shouldn’t interfere with my work hours. He instantly got defensive. He asked, “Why are you taking more classes??” I immediately knew that I had hit the switch and was overcome by dread. I responded, “Uhh, well I decided to start working on my associates in web development, but I’m still working towards my degree in networking.” He started going on this rant about how irresponsible I am and that I’m not serious about my job and how dare I go into web development. Without missing a beat, he said “Do you even want to continue working here??” My heart was beating a million miles an hour, I was so surprised at his reaction. I would fully understand him getting frustrated at my schedule change, but to out right explode? I had no idea how to react. Tears started to well up in my eyes and I choked out “Yes, of course I want to work here.” He continued by questioning by decision to even consider web development. “Did you even consider the job market, opportunities, salary, benefits??” At this point, I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack. I could barely even let out a coherent sentence to defend myself. I just said “Yeah, of course”. I could tell he saw my weakness and he took advantage of this and told me that I’m a very confused person and that I’m not making good decisions in my life and that I would never be successful. I just shut down, I had no idea how to respond to this. I just kept quiet and waited for it to be over. 


This was all in front of my co-workers and I new that they heard the entire thing and I’m just mortified to even go back there after this incident. I’ve been considering leaving for a long time now, but I was hoping to tough it out while I looked for other jobs. Now I realize that it’s unhealthy for me to stay there any longer than I already have. I know that I must step away from this experience being the bigger person.  I’ve already been there for 9 months and I don’t want to throw away valuable experience that I can put on my resume for future jobs. My fiancé recommended that I sit down and discuss what happened with him and have a 3rd party mediate the entire thing and put in my 2 weeks notice. That way, I can resolve the situation and leave knowing that I handled it professionally. 


How do I handle this discussion in a professional manner, even after all that has happened? Also, if anyone else has any further advice I would deeply appreciate it.



**TL;DR** – I told my boss a few weeks in advance that I would need to modify my schedule but that it won’t affect the amount of hours I work. He asked why, and I told him that I’m also getting a web development degree in addition to my networking degree. He blew up on me, threatened to fire me, and proceeded to criticize me and tell me I was going to be a failure.

Edit: I'm not asking if I should quit. I'm just asking for advice to respectfully walk away from this job without burning my bridges.

How to find a career you enjoy?,49,7yveoh,"I'm going to be 27 next month. I have 5.5k in savings, and I want to change careers. I hate what I do now, and I make ~23k a year.

I attended college for 7 years, and never found anything that I enjoyed. I have switched majors 4 times, been to 3 career counselors, and one life counselor. I have attended a few career meetings at colleges, and took 2 career help-type classes while in school. I even opened up to a professor for advice a few times, and he wasn't sure what the right answer was. The counselors all came to the conclusion that I may never find a job I enjoy.

I really don't want to go back to school. I wasted years of my life and thousands of dollars. I transferred schools twice, and never really felt school was for me. I've never enjoyed a minute of it, and honestly don't think I ever want to go back again.

I am 95% confident that I will never find a job I love, and will just have to settle with the job I hate the least. How do you go about searching for jobs. Is there any hope for me yet? What steps can I take to help my situation?

&#x200B;

So here's my story: I'm a 29 year old male who received his BFA in Graphic Design back in 2012. After 2 years of searching for a job within the design field and fining absolutely no luck, I decided to give graphic design a break and take up an English teaching job over in Japan for a year. After returning I was refreshed and eager to get back into design. But after a year of searching I found nothing.

By this point I have gotten burnt out and personally bitter towards the graphic design field; twice I got an email/call saying I had the position only to be turned down because someone's cousin or sibling needed a job. So after a total of almost 4 year getting rejection after rejection my once burning passion for design has turned into full blown resentment.

Fast forward and I have been working at a logistics company now for two years, started in the call center portion but about a year ago got promoted to a scheduling position. But I've noticed I don't have a passion for logistics, nor does my company pay well (they actually pay under the national and even state average salary).

"Made lateral move 6 months ago, but company is looking like a sinking ship. How do I explain this to recruiters/hiring managers? [x-post /r/jobs]",49,ac65k4,"I started at this company 2 years ago as an entry-level mechanical applications engineer in the US. A year into that job, they decided to halt development of several product lines that weren't selling super well (including mine), the job went from ""very technical"" to ""not technical"" (i.e. entirely sales support), so 6 months ago I made a lateral move in the company. I had started working on a masters degree, so I figured I would stay with the company. 

However, we recently got some news that the company is about to undergo a major restructure, including getting rid of a division, and a new ""focus"" that really has a lot of us wondering if we'll be next. Our plant has already started outsourcing several parts, and functions including: HR, IT, and accounting to the 3rd world. They have also stopped replacing guys who retire. 

Yesterday I was shooting the shit with a higher up, and he told me that corporate is planning to make us all reapply for our jobs, and will most likely offer a ""buyout"" to get older employees to retire early. 

On top of that, we have had several ""travel bans"" since I started, and wages have been frozen. Since my transfer was lateral, they offered no salary increase, so I make less (considering rising health insurance, not to mention inflation) than I did 2 years ago. Finally, at my new site we've already had 2 senior engineers quit in the last 6 months and not get replaced, making more work for the rest of us. 

If I knew it would be like this, I would have left the company instead of transferring. However, what's done is done. 

My question is if I start actively looking for work, how do I explain the fact that I'm looking 6 months after starting a job without sounding like I'm ""badmouthing"" the company or sounding like a job hopper? I'm not just ""looking for new challenges"" or any of that shit - I don't want to risk getting laid off, doing several guys' job, or watching my paycheck shrink further. At my experience level, I know I'm underpaid by $15k, so just getting paid market wages would offset any repayment for tuition, so I'm not even worried about that.",2019-01-03 16:25:10

"High paying jobs, low GPA, How do I proceed at this point in my life?",49,9zw2hh,"Greetings,

I'm having some difficulty in my life right now and I could use some advice.

**First, a little about me.** I'm 30, I have a Biochem Degree (ug: 2.54 gpa cum, 2.68 cum current), and I presently work in the Oil/Energy industry. I make around 120k-140k per year depending on overtime, I have no family, no debt, and I absolutely hate my job. I hate it so much, that I am considering positions that pay 60-80k a year, provided that their schedule makes it possible for me to return to school, in some capacity. I don't own a home. Oh yeah, and my shitty job has rotating shift work, making it **impossible** to do absolutely anything but work there. I can't volunteer, I can't take classes, nothing. I just have to work there.

&#x200B;

**Now, my dilemma:** I feel as though I'm not working in the position that I desire. I gain no satisfaction from my job, and I don't feel like I am progressing at all. I feel like I'm completely stagnating. I should mention that I never once liked what I was doing, the reason that I am in this field is because I didn't try for graduate school based on my low GPA.

My life at this point basically consists of working as much OT as possible (because why not? if I'm stuck in this situation I might as well just keep hoarding cash), and when I'm not working, I read books, watch TV, or play video games.

I would say that working towards a goal is a major component of my life, and right now, it seems like my goals are off limits and have been ever since I've stepped out of college. And so... I just exist. I exist purely to earn money (horrible). 

&#x200B;

**Things that I want to do but probably can't:** I have an interest in medicine, but as you know the requirements for Medical school, PA school, nursing school, etc are just off the charts when it comes to grade point average. The average for a lot of these programs is above a 3.6 GPA, which is almost a full grade point above where I'm sitting at. 

**Other things that I could potentially do**: Film school seems interesting, I find that I enjoy doing video editing in my free time and I've always had a dream of going into the film industry. Law school doesn't really seem interesting to me, but I could potentially go to a law school with lower requirements. Masters programs are doable (some of them) although I wouldn't dream of getting a masters degree in a high science. I'd prefer to do a PA program, as it's not as long as an MD/DO program and still allows you to practice medicine in a meaningful way. The issue with a PA program is that the requirements are just off the charts GPA wise. 

&#x200B;

So what do I do? Do I get a lower paying job that allows me to go back to a community college? At that point, what do I do? I was considering taking the PA prerequisite classes and just applying in the hopes that a school might accept me (if I score well enough on the GRE to offset my garbage grade point average). Honestly, I'm at a huge loss here. I've felt trapped in this same shit-routine for years now since graduating college and I want out. **I want to do something that I actually WANT to do for once and not what I am forced to do.** I feel like for most of my professional life, I've been advancing in this shitty industry by just stomaching my disdain and working hard. I'm sick of this shit.

"I've never been offered a job by people who don't know me. Is my job history typical, lucky, or a poor reflection on me?",48,8u6gvo,"I'm in my thirties and have been looking back at my career since I graduated college 15 years ago. I started a spreadsheet for every job I ever applied to and what became of it.

My first job was from an internship during college. I applied for 42 jobs and the only offer was from my internship.

After a few years I got bored and started looking for a new job. Without kids I could go anywhere I wanted to. I applied for 18 jobs and the only one who offered me a job was from a relationship I had from my first job.

A few years after that I got bored again and applied for 13 jobs. The only offer was from a connection I had through my current job.

Fast forward to now. I have two kids, a wife, and mortgage. Except I'm bored again and really unable to move. Yes, I may be chasing happiness that doesn't exist, but this post is about a job search. I reached out to a few people, got a few calls from recruiters, and guess what... the only offer was from a firm I already knew.

Point is the relationships you make working are far more important than anything else. You don't need to sell your skills if people already know your character. Perhaps my technical skills are lacking but I have been able to overcome them with relationships.

Is this typically or have I been really lucky?",2018-06-27 06:52:38
"I've been struggling to get my own career, and not jobs that I hate. What should I do?",48,bpp9vj,"FYI: I'm in the UK in regards to the school system

Long story short, was living in a hostel (basically homeless but council helped) and recently moved into a new place.

I ended up quitting my sales 'job' 10 days after I started it due to the mental and physical toll it took on me. Now I'm just sort of sitting at home, thinning about how I never had a job which I would love.

I love programming, web development and the idea of making games. I'm 90% self taught with 3 years of academic experience in coding (high school + sixth form) 

I've attempted applying for web dev jobs but didn't have enough experience for them (since I'm self taught I know no industry standard or have professional experience). I've got my own website (I'm changing it, I'm just very slow about it) www.damianglen.co.uk and I tried social advertising and haven't achieved any results from trying to do it myself.

Now because my family is sort of weird and in a bad place there's all this pressure to get just any job to help, but Ideally one that pays well.

I suppose the big question is where can I get a job related to programming, web dev+design or game making where experience isn't necessary, where I can learn and earn at the same time.

Any thoughts are appreciated tbh.

Uninternationally put a glass ceiling on my career. What now?,52,bfpiy2,"I’ve been at this job for a bit. It’s a pretty safety sensitive role that oversees public travel. 


You need qualifications to work in each area. When I started I was keen as mustard and busted balls to get my first qualification.


This didn’t go unnoticed. Pretty soon I was asked to start training in another area. This area is more complex so initially I was pretty stoked.


Big fucking mistake. Lots of people fluked out of training because it’s so easy to make massive mistakes. We get investigated for mistakes and can even get pay cuts if we make too many errors. The programming we use is 20 years out of date (it still relies on fax!) and there are too few staff. This means we get abused by clients for being slow. The old system leads to a huge backlog of work so more mistakes happen, more abuse, moral goes down, people leave, and then the cycle begins again. The computer program for the other job is more user friendly which means less mistakes (it catches errors).


Qualified staff in this area are as rare as hen’s teeth. But it’s a blessing in disguise. For example, I was required to be on standby for all holidays (whereas most people who just have the first qualification are free to go). But the biggest problem is that we don’t get released for anything - other training (eg leadership courses), inductions, or admin time. We are expected to do admin tasks for promotions but every request for admin time for myself has been rejected due to “operational requirements”. A couple of colleagues with the more basic qualifications have gotten their admin time, get the same pay, and have the better system (less mistakes).



The other thing is that our area can’t spare anyone for secondment or to act up in management spots. This means I have to completely switch departments to possibly get a chance to pursue any sort of management role. We can get knocked back for internal roles due to “operational reasons” too.


I’m doing okay in the role and have been identified as being good with conflict resolution. This means that I’m commonly tasked to deal with all the angry, rude clients because I don’t fold to their demands. It’s the turd cherry on a shit frosted cake. I feel like I’m essentially being punished for being a decent worker. 


I’ve come to the sad realisation that I shot myself in the foot. I’m stuck in this role. What can I do? Start fluking stuff in an effort to go into the other areas? Keep trying for other internal roles? Or just focus on an exit strategy? And if I do get a new career how to stop myself from getting lumped with the tougher areas in the future without burning opportunities?",2019-04-21 17:45:46
Is it possible for grad school to be too easy?,52,bdjghq,"I am a 30 year old accountant looking to get an MBA to get further in my career.  I am turned off to some of the major schools because they are so expensive and the jobs that would help recoup those costs probably require more of me than I want to give.  

My mentor suggested looking into a local program that is 1/3 of the price of the bigger schools.  I audited a class and I honestly could have taught the class better than the professor.  Kind of a perfect storm, the professor didn't have a big experience in this particular subject and it was something I have a lot of experience in.  But my fear is that I will spend $30,000 to get the degree, but not learn much and not be challenged.  I want to earn more, but also to learn more, and get jobs with more responsibility.

I love my work most of the time, I work with great people.. But I'm making $37k yearly. I had a lot of raise in the last 3 years - coming from $25k/year salary. I think it will take a lot of time before I get another raise.

My goal is to make $50-60k a year. I don't care what it takes, as long as I'm in the same field. 

I have a lot of skills to offer.. I'm torn between getting a secondary job (part-time preferably)  or open my own agency helping small company/startup.

I'm in the marketing field focusing on product launch, ppc, copywriting and  social media management. Other skills I learned throughout the years are Photoshop, Illustrator, PPC, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Solidworks for product development.

"Newly disabled, and not sure how to refocus my [industrial design] career. Any advice? Details inside.",48,alke01,"Thank you in advance to anyone who can help. **TLDR** at the bottom.

Me: 31, male, mixed race, university educated

I’m currently battling a rare form of cancer, that although initially diagnosed as terminal I was able to get into a clinical trial and now have a semi-reasonable chance at making it through this.

The not so good news is that the damage already caused to my immune system is largely permanent, and I will be severely immunodeficient for the rest of my life. 

Limitations are not great - I’ve been told to expect, with treatment, to be able to be around groups of as many as 5-10 people occasionally, and to expect to spend most of my time around 2-3 at most. 

I’ve spent my whole adult life working in industrial design, but always in an office setting and as part of a design team. It’s a very ‘people’ focused day-to-day type of work as it requires a lot of collaboration that is usually face-to-face. It also requires a lot of international travel for factory visits, meeting with vendors, etc. Not something I can do without interacting frequently with many people.

My practical skills are:
•Conceptual Drawing
•Sewing
•Natural & Synthetic Textile Dyeing
•Sublimation
•3D Printing
•Painting
•Woodworking
•Sculpting
•Leatherworking
•Moulding (Hand, and Injection)
•Prototyping

My more professional skills are:
•Adobe design software (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, etc.)
•Networking
•Design Direction
•Team Building & Leading
•Collaborative Design Thinking

My goal is to find something that is fulfilling, but not too physical (I still have 2-3 years of cancer treatment left), that I can do from home. I am open to the idea of starting my own business and working from home, since I hope I have plenty of time to plan.

Salary isn’t important - keeping my mind sharp while I go through treatment is.

**TLDR**: Any creative ‘work from home’ careers out there that someone with a decade+ corporate product design experience can switch to?

"How to avoid interviewing at places that are a bad cultural fit (namely, startups)?",47,8oyszk,"Hi /careerguidance,

So I posted \[a thread\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8o86wc/would\_you\_except\_a\_counteroffer\_with\_no\_salary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8o86wc/would_you_except_a_counteroffer_with_no_salary/)) the other day and got a lot of awesome insights into my current job predicament.

I don't want to be that guy that just opens threads (and never contributes to others, which I fully intend to!), but this is a question I could really use some input to. So here goes.

Basically, after four years of freelancing for, and working at, small startup organizations, I've come to realize that I'm a horrible fit for the kind of culture that usually comes with that size of company (I kind of fell into my two in\-house positions at them without considering the importance 'culture' would have on my job satisfaction).

Things that I don't like, for example, in roughly the order that they bother me:

* **Loud**, **open\-plan workspaces** (as in bullpens; I'm a marketing writer and find these environments often make getting quality work done almost impossible)
* Companies **without formalized growth trajectories** \- or with none at all
* **Dogs in the office** \- which amp up the visual distractions just a notch further!
* Pointless staff 'benefits' such as **foosball tables and happy hours** at work \- which to my mind, usually serve to obfuscate somewhat dysfunctional working environments.

At this point in my career, I'm looking to work somewhere **more stable, better organized, and which has a clear path along which I can advance.** I feel like I'm passed the stage where photos of a bottle of IPA, or a slice of pizza, splashed over a company Facebook page it supposed to get me excited about working there.

Unfortunately, this seems to cut out a huge chunk of the job market here \- as I'm sure it would in most countries. But I feel like being more selective now will yield a better outcome in the long run, and avoid many of the revolving door workplaces that seem to proliferate in this tier of organizational size.

Many times, I'm able to read between the lines on **Glassdoor, or see the company's office photos on their Facebook page** (or Google Images), and see straight away that it's not the kind of place I'm going to enjoy working at. Other times, though, I'm flying blind, and have gone on several 'pointless' interviews recently for that very reason.

***What's the best way I can (tactfully) screen out these kind of companies during the phone interview stage?***

I feel like the Grinch admitting to people possibly working at these companies that things like 'company happy hours' and 'fun days' aren't the first things I want to hear about them.

Is it rude, at the very initial stage of the interview process, to ask specific questions about things like the work environment (open plan / cubicle / offices), dogs at the office, etc? Is there a less direct line of questioning I can use that will yield the same information?

Today i found out that there isn't enough students enrolling (many from my group are satisfied with the Associate because that's all you need to work in libraries, even as a 'librarian' here and the college has seen overall drop in enrollment) and therefore the program won't run.

Some backstory; Im 27 and I currently work in a primary school library where i also teach reading and comprehension skills. Therefore, i want get a degree related to something with literacy.
My current options are; go the of the regions largest university (the associate degree really helped me here) to do a Literature and Linguistics with Education degree (5 years part time) or wait for them to run the degree at my current institution.
My original plan once i figured out what i wanted to do was to do literature to teach but i choose a Bsc in LIS at the community college because i couldn't get into a major university here in the caribbean because i didnt have A levels.

"I accepted a ""Sr."" job. On my first day, ""Senior"" was taken out of my job title. Are my employer's reasons legit? Are job titles important?",47,80hna1,"Background: I started a new job two weeks ago at a large company as a ""Sr. Advertising Compliance Specialist."" It's a newly created job where I'll be between the legal department and the company's ad agencies. My interviewers liked my past experiences: I was a paralegal for three years and had marketing/advertising positions before that. I'm trying to move away from the legal field, so this job seemed like a good transition. 

On my first day, I was introduced to the team as a ""paralegal"" and at one point a ""legal assistant."" Being a ""paralegal"" and ""legal assistant"" bothered me. I was actively turning down these roles during my job search. There's nothing wrong with these roles. I just want to move away from legal support staff work and more towards marketing/advertising.

I met with my supervisor privately to ask about about the title confusion. She said she didn't know about me being ""Sr. Ad Compliance Specialist"" and blamed the contracting companies (I'm technically a contractor) for not communicating better. I let her know that I was avoiding a paralegal title. She understood, but she said she'd take out the ""senior"" in my title because:

- Even with my past legal and marketing roles, I didn't have direct advertising law experience, and I would have to go through training, so the ""Sr."" would be inappropriate.
- No one in my team has a ""Sr"" title in the ad compliance team. The team is made up of two attorneys and a paralegal. My supervisor wants the paralegal and I to be equals. (She later asked the paralegal if she'd like to be called an “Ad Compliance Specialist"" as well, and paralegal confirmed that she would.)
- there will be chances for promotion to achieve the ""senior"" title.

My grievances/concerns about this:

- I'm 25 years old and this other paralegal/ad compliance specialist is 45+. I'm significantly younger than most of my department. A part of me wonders if this is about age. Yes, it would be polarizing if someone 20 years younger than me came in and held a senior title, but why should the younger person be penalized? Would my supervisor be uncomfortable with a ""Senior” position if I were older than my coworker?
- This coworker has been in the same position for 3 years (and still a contractor for some reason), so I'm not optimistic about the chances of a promotion.
- I signed my contractor forms with the ""Sr. Ad Compliance Specialist” title. Why should I be told to earn what I had been hired for?

I tried talking to my contracting firm about this, and they were pretty unhelpful. They blamed communication errors with the company's HR and their vendor management system. Oh and job titles aren't that important and I should be a team player. Someone else from the firm warned me that one candidate (same company, different position) was too insistent on a job title, so the company rescinded their offer.

I tried not to think of this too much because my name in the company's online system was still ""Sr. Ad Compliance Specialist” for the first two weeks. Then my frustration came today when our online system said ""Contract- Ad Compliance Specialist."" The frustration for me isn't that I'm not a ""senior"" position. I'm frustrated because the reasons for my title change/demotion seem wack: my apparent ""lack of experience"" (despite having lots of experience to talk about in my interviews) and possibly my youth.

Am I wrong to feel this is kind of unfair? Any advice?

How to get into Data Analysis?,48,a155jm,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

About 12 months ago I started programming, I learned basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript. Then decided to try Python as it just 'looked' better. Started with basics but then discovered I liked analysing data so went with it and for past 8 months I've focused on Python, R, bits of Excel, Tableau, SQL. I got a Udacity Schoolarship which got me a Nanodegree in Data Analysis, did few other courses online, done some small project.

I've now decided to leave my full time job as, after over 4 years in hospitality, I felt like I can't be dealing with hotel guests anymore. This is my final week and I was going to spend a month intensively studying and applying for jobs. The only problem is - I can't seem to find any data analysis jobs. The ones I find are either Excel VBA (that I'm not good at and won't get me using other programming languages I learned) or Data Science where they expect you to have PhD in Statistics and know 10 programming languages. When I actually do find a Data Analysis job they want 5 years of experience. 

&#x200B;

How do I get into data jobs? Where do I find them, how do I skip the 'min 5 years experience and Masters in Statistics' with what I've got which are online courses? Any advice will be highly appreciated as I'm slowly starting to panic that I won't find anything. I even thought of working 2-3 months for free just to learn and get something for the CV but I don't even know where to look for these jobs (I live in UK). ",2018-11-28 12:48:50

I'm currently on unpaid leave while HR ""investigates"" my recent angry, profane tirade at work.

This keeps happening, over and over. there has to be a job out there I can do.

&#x200B;

I fall apart in fast environments, boring environments, teamwork environments, stressful environments. I job hop consistently. Full time jobs are the worst.

&#x200B;

Fast food -- lasted 2 weeks. Will not even bother. Retail, off and on for 9 years, but quit every single job the same way: exploded in blinding, tunnel visioned anger, and walked out. My most recent job, at a hospital as a medical records clerk. This job brought on stressors that I've never encountered at any other job, and I've blown up twice. It's not worth trying to save this job. I just need to move on. but I don't know what the f to do. everything is overwhelming. I have applied to disability, but I still need a job. my boyfriend can't pay the bills on his own.

Is there anyone out there that can offer advice???",2018-10-21 17:24:07
"Looking for a new job due to sexual assault, and i'm not sure how/if to address this in interviews?",48,9poc2h,"Long story short, I got a new job roughly 2 months ago - the very married head of our whole department took me home one night after a few drinks and came at me in the back of a cab with lots of no's, and lots of physical forcing. He's apologetic, etc. but it's just become an issue now. He's trying to keep me to stay (I'm sure because he feels guilty), but I'm uncomfortable for many reasons (for instance, his wife works next to me) and it's making my job harder to keep finding ways not to communicate with him or to just work with him. He's also made comments about how my birth country should be burned to the ground to just add more cherries on top (hilariously, I got told off for bringing up politics with him, so his comment was my fault).

&#x200B;

I have a pretty solid background right now, good references, was in my first job for 2 years - added new products and methodology to that first company, but I'm nervous about jumping my second job after only 2 months and how I'm supposed to address leaving in interviews.  Should I tell the truth about what happened? Is that TMI? If not, is there any way to look okay after jumping a job in 2 months?

Lost a job offer due to a bad reference but the HR wont disclose the name of referral. Is this legal?,46,995ep9,"I left the company in Nov last year on good terms as I moved back to my hometown. Now I am back in the city and applied for another post at the same company.

As far as I am aware my manager and team leader had left the company in the same year that I worked in and I listed them both as my referrals in the CV. The HR lady went for an internal reference but referred to neither of them two. She mentioned that an Operations Manager had decided to veto my hiring. I probably never even met this guy in person who knows. I called my old manager about the situation and he said he is okay to give a reference for me should they call him. He even offered to interview me for a job in his new company as he know I am still searching for one. But I am really dissatisfied with the HRs response to undisclose the referals name.

My brother offered my a job in a new industry, but that means leaving everything I've learned behind - is this ever a good idea?",50,8tnlug,"I have spent the last 12 years working in big business and management.  Most recently at my peak I was a regional manager for a large fortune 50 company.  After being left without support in my role for many months, I eventually cracked and resigned.  I went in to a lesser business role with another company for significantly less pay, and attending career therapy/counselling.

10 months post-burn out and I just don't feel the same about working in management.  I can't see myself going back to it, even if the pay is great.

Enter brother, he works as an engineer for the railway.  He can sponsor my application for an entry-level position with his railway which will pay me nearly as much as I was making as a regional manager.  I can't even believe how much he and his co-workers make working on the rail yard.  With my experience and willingness he doesn't think getting in will be a problem - he has been there 12 years and carries some weight in his position.

I'm scared.  This is a new frontier for me.

No experience & a Psycholgy Bachelor’s – is a career in IT possible?,45,a0m52a,"Looking for a little guidance and was hoping someone here could help out as I know nothing about the field. My little brother is a 2017 college grad. He has a Bachelor’s in Psychology. He got a Bachelor’s in Psychology because he had no idea what he wanted to do when enrolling in college, waited until the last minute when he had to declare a major and figured he liked those classes best so went with psych. He didn’t actually put any thought into how he would use the degree in the future. During high-school & college summers he worked at a pool store.  Post college graduation he gets a job working in a supply yard selling to customers and doing deliveries for $12/hr. Here we are almost 2 years later at this point and he’s still working in the same supply yard for $12/hr.

I’m constantly on his case about finding a new job and trying to put his degree to use. With all the student loans he has $12/hr isn’t going to cut it if he wants to pay off that debt, have a family, a house, car that isn’t falling apart etc. What he tells me is that he has no idea what he wants to do. He is admittedly anti-social and does not want to have any sort of customer facing or sales related job. While there is a sales aspect of his current job, he’s not actually pitching anything – the customers are laborers and come to the yard already knowing exactly what they need and how much of it etc. he just gets it and loads it up for them.

Our conversations always lead to the IT field. He's tech savy and really enjoys tech. For example he’s always got multiple computer builds going on, constantly upgrading his PCs & Laptops and building others for his friends and family with old parts etc. He has no experience with programming but is genuinely interested in the field. It’s a shame he chose a psych degree but at this point it’s too late.

My question is – are there any types of entry level roles that are in the IT field where someone with a Psychology Bachelor’s and no experience in IT can get into? If so where does one look for a role like that? Everything I can find is looking for tech related degrees and/or prior experience. I think if he can find a way in somehow he can be very successful, he’s absolutely a hard and reliable worker.

How to handle job applications when you would prefer multiple recent employers not be contacted?,50,96bd3h,"I worked at a previous job for about a year and then was laid off.

How to start a career as a 32yr old female with no experience?,46,8zex65,"I'm 32, I have a business degree which I consider useless and not much relevant work experience. I've had a bunch of jobs in accounting and other things when I was younger but I hated them so 5 years ago I quit everything to play poker.

I'm trying to get back into the workforce now but I find it impossible. I've sent 50 CVs and I don't even get a call back. I just moved to a country where I don't speak the language but I'm fluent in other two that are in high demand here, and I still can't even get an interview.

I guess I should add some value to my CV studying something but I have no clue what. At this point of my life I don't want to go back to college, I just want something quick that will get me a job other than customer support. It would be ideal to start a career in something I can do as a freelancer later on, once I have kids in a couple years. I considered coding but all the job offers I see even for junior roles require some experience or more education than a Udemy course. And I also think I might be too old for that, who would hire a 32yr old junior coder with no experience who learnt a bit online?

I know I suck but I have to do something to suck less I guess.

"Told I had to wait 6 months for promotion, found out younger colleague has since been promoted to senior level. Should I look for a new job?",46,8nzjdd,"I (30M) have nearly a decade of experience in the construction industry and recently had my annual appraisal 1 month ago, whereby it was confirmed by my director that I was ready to be promoted to Senior Project Manager. Obviously I was pleased and felt great about being recognised for my hard work.
After lots of radio silence, I was eventually told I would need to wait 6 months as the decision needed to be confirmed by the owners of the firm. I was abit annoyed but went with the flow.
Last week I saw on LinkedIn a younger colleague who has a family friend connection to one of the owners has been promoted to Senior Project Manager despite being several years younger and vastly less experienced than I (He has 3 years experience in the industry) . When I joined the company 20 months ago, he was still an assistant undertaking his masters.

I am currently seconded to a client full time and despite my achievements, often feel completely forgotten about. I have won several contracts through this client for the company and obtained professional chartership in the process  (in fact I am one of the only chartered members in the team).

Right now I feel quite raw and feel I am being fobbed off with excuses about why I have to wait. A trusted colleague told me she thought it was due to a budgetary issue and they have instead spent the budget promoting my less experienced colleague... If this is the case, why can't my superiors just confirm this? 

The way I'm feeling right now, all I want to do is look for a new job but am aware of my previous job hopping (5 jobs in 9 years, shortest 6 months, longest 2 years).

"Anxiety at work, saving up for a Career change. How do I manage this situation?",45,ax4s6r,"Hi, this is a long post so thanks if you read it all and respond!

Im 27 m and work in pharmacy. Last year after burnout and mental illness, I moved to another country and spent seven months working and living in customer service and teaching English. I had a great time, and I didn't want to come back-finances and losing my apartment meant I had to, which I guess was a blessing in disguise, because I had to tackle some bills and obligations back home.

In October, I came back, renewed my licence and took a part time job where I wasn't happy. I just didn't take to the owner of the business, he was a nice man but ever present, and I didn't really feel comfortable. I left to do locum work, which is kind of like free-lancing, but the work was sporadic and the travel was a lot.  

At this point (last November) I decided that I just didn't want to work in pharmacy. I don't like it: its too high pressure, I don't have the mentality to hit corporate's bullshit targets or to deal with idiot customers, plus with depression and anxiety, this job just exacerbates my problem.

I decided that I want to change my career to software development/web design and to relocate back to Spain (where I spent much of last year) and get my life back on track. I'm tired of being a depressed, lonely, loser and I need to make changes before it's too late and i'm too old to do so. So to further this, i'm saving up to relocate and go to a coding bootcamp over there. That's my dream and it's possible; all i'm doing this year is to reach. that. goal.

So, in January, I took a full time position for a chain of pharmacies, I applied for a floating role in my city, but they changed it to a store based role in a town 90 minutes away from me after the interview. Stupid me took it. The store is understaffed, there is so much work I genuinely cannot believe it. I don't get on with my co-workers, and i'm so stressed out and anxious I really cannot function. This is after ONE month! I keep on making mistakes, which on reflection is obviously my fault but also due to the ridiculous demands i'm under. This weekend, I've been having a 3 day long panic attack, minimal sleep, won't go out or turn my phone in due to fear of calls from work, it's nuts.

Now my ray of light in all this, is that 2 weeks after joining this hell hole, I decided to go to an interview for a totally different pharmacy role in a nursing home (no scripts to fill, no customers, less money, less stress). They basically gave me the job in the interview, although (due to security) it could take up to 3 months, and that I should expect communication from them shortly.

My problem is I need another job now. Just thinking about going into work tomorrow is making my head spin and my guts churn, last Thursday I was almost ran over and wished the guy didn't slow down. Mentally speaking, i'm all over the place.

 I'm living with my mother at the minute who is also a pharmacist, she says that i'm bouncing around too much and that I need to be stable, endure this for a while and all will be OK. She said that she's worried that eventually I'll turn out to be the kind of person that doesn't want to work, and that everyone suffers and that I have to just deal with the pressure that i'm under.

Personally, I understand where she's coming from, because i'm earning good money here; it allows me to save up and yeah its the easy thing to do. But: 1. This job is really affecting my mental health, and 2. I'm only waiting for this other job to come through so I can bounce anyway.

So how do I proceed? Do I stick it out until maybe april/may where I am? Do I go back with my tail between my legs to my old boss and ask him for my old job back? Do I ask my prospective job to hurry the fuck up so I can start working there ASAP? Should I just take a call centre job and just accept a decrease in my earnings for this year until I can go back and retrain?

Let me know what you think, i'm sorry if that was a rambling mess, my head is all over the place at the minute.

TLDR: My job is causing me unbearable stress and anxiety, I need another job ASAP, but also need money and to stay employed, what should I do?

"Those who completed a higher education program after age 35, do you feel disadvantaged now compared to your younger colleagues?",46,ankohg,"Hello reddit,

As someone who is exploring shunning a ten-year career and heading back to grad school for a math-oriented master’s program, I’m curious if anyone has experienced this.  I already think it will be “weird” to be in a master’s program at my age, but I’m really interested in the tangible drawbacks of going to grad school.  

So, those of you who had the higher education epiphany later in life than average-  do you feel like you landed in your target industry with enough time to truly realize the benefit of investing so heavily in your education? Did you feel at a disadvantage compared to younger colleagues? And of course the $100,000 question- Would you do it again? 

A little bit more about me if you are interested…graduated with a BA in Marketing in 2008.  Went into the broadcast TV industry and quickly found myself climbing the rungs of an analyst-type career, with my most recent position title of “Director of Market Research” (it’s a much more grandiose title than the work). In 2015, due to turbulence in the TV industry, I was able to negotiate a healthy salary creeping into 6 figures.  That was short lived though as my position was downsized at the end of 2018.  I’m trying to decide if I can realize dreams (grad school, career change) or if it’s a wiser move to try and find a position comparable to what I had and look at deriving self-actualization from hobbies.

Some issues,

- feel guilty for logging off

-no relationship with co workers

- communication can be tricky

-occasional loneliness

What to say when interviewers ask for a desired salary?,45,9gznkm,"This question always throws me off. For background, I am a recent graduate with a Biology and English degree. I have worked as a research assistant and a lab tech through my university. I actually have a decent amount of experience in lab management, managing grant money, and protocol design. I know I don’t have a plethora of experience, but I do have more than the typical fresh college graduate. 

I recently was offered a job as a research associate with a salary of 33k. I was also told I was well over qualified and would be underpaid. But, I accepted the job because, gotta start somewhere. 
I recently got an interview with another larger company. I want to prepare for that same question. I checked Glassdoor, and for the position I am interviewing for, the average reported salary is 54k.... so if they ask, I am afraid to say that because it seems so high! I don’t want to come off as cocky or them turn me away for a question like that.

Obviously, considering the debt I am in (also fully dependent from parents so paying for rent, car insurance, phone c etc) I would really like to make more than 33k. I’m barely making a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, as my student loans aren’t cheap. 

What’s the best way to answer this question without overshooting, or undershooting? ",2018-09-19 01:51:14
"My department boss constantly ""bullies"" me if I refuse to work extra days. I really need help dealing with it. What can I do?",45,86ochz,"I have 3 different work schedules. One week I work mornings, the next afternoons and lastl, I work nights. Repeat. To make it worse, we work practically 7 days in a row.

When we work nights, we start 0:00 Monday and we leave 8:00 Saturday. Then we start with the morning schedule on Thursday.

Since August, they have been asking for people to work that last Sunday of the night week. I said yes...a little more money can't hurt and the company gives me the day on top of paying it.

Everything was good until I couldn't work on that Sunday and my boss came to me to ask if I was available to work. I just said that I was sorry but that I couldn't make it, had family plans, etc. And then he just stood there staring at me with a pretty disgusting grin. He walked away and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day.

For the remaining of the week, every time I called him (we and other people of our department have company phones since we deal with assembling and selling of products between other departments and need to be on constant communication) he would answer with something like ""What do you want?"" or ""Don't you have anything else to do other than calling me over and over?"" and in the last few hours of the day, he would just hang up on me.

On that week's Friday, he asked me again if he could count on me to work Sunday and I just said if it was really necessary for me to come, if couldn't anyone else cover for me and he just said ""I need 2 people, you and another one"". I just said whatever, I'll come.

So yeah I worked that Sunday.

3 weeks later, we are working night again and on Wednesday, he comes to me again and I tell him before anything ""If it's for Sunday, I can't, I had plans the last time and had to cancel them, can't make it this time."" And then that freaking grin again. Then the freak tells me that evaluations are coming and that working extra days is a heavy point in our scores. At that point he leaves and I just start thinking that this guy is messing me up. This has been happening every single time I'm working nights.

Every time I work nights I pray for the time he won't come asking me to work Sunday, I just reply ""If it's really necessary..."" and bang, my name's on the list. This has gotten to a point where I just want to cry after he leaves.

I just can't say fucking No to this guy. Why am I even afraid of this guy telling me that working extra is a heavy point in our evaluations? I literally came to work every AM-Sunday since August. I've worked holidays. I come early and leave late. I've worked while being sick. I would bet my eyesight if anyone has gave more time of their life to the freaking company than I did in the last months.

To make it EXTRA worse, he has a few people under his wing (that do the same work as me and can perfectly replace me), that constantly don't work extra and worse worse worse, they're not even asked to. I have more than 15 days, days that are not considered vacation days, to spend and he'll just say he can't allow me to leave because they need me, while every other guy asks and receives.

I mean hell, one of his guys isn't working a single fucking day until the 4th because of Easter. He would probably laugh at my face if I ever asked for the same ""deal"".

I'm desperate and I'm sorry if this looks like a rant, but please, I need help.

I can't leave this job otherwise I would have done it a long time ago, because of the schedule alone.

What are some good resources to figure out what I want to do for a living - when I’m in my 30s?,45,86fl17,"I graduated 8 years ago with a loved but unused liberal arts degree. My “dream” job back then pretty much required a graduate degree, which I didn’t - and still don’t - have the time and money for. I ended up in an office job, which lead to accounting work. I have worked in accounting for the past 6 years, and have been a salaried Staff Accountant for 3 years. I haven’t made great money over this time; my current company justified my lower-than-market wage based on my lack of an accounting degree.

I’m wholly burnt out of my current job and for many reasons I believe it’s time to leave my company. Of course I don’t want to do that without something else lined up, but the thought of another job in accounting makes me feel dead inside.

Can you make a midlife career change in something that isn't coding?,44,b53awk,"As the title says, what real options are out there for someone to build a career in that does not mean becoming a software developer? This is not to rule out software development, but the fact that is there any other possible solution over the next 10 years that can still manage to work out if someone applies now to work towards that career in such a fast pace and changing job market?  


As someone in their mid 30's and a terrible Communication degree, I have no real solid background in a career beyond retail, call centers, and data entry. I wanted a second degree but funding is incredibly difficult after you already have your first. I know there is the 'learn to code' mantra but one has to REALLY love every waking moment of doing this and make sure they are living and breathing it at least a solid 2 or more years as they develop the hard way if they are not a recent CS grad looking for work. It is not always the solution for every individual.  


So my question is, are there really any other options? Medical fields that require an advanced degree and money to back it up are out of the question like a doctor or Vet. I'm too old to join the military or learning to fly. So what options can one build a career in as we see a world change through automation in the next 10 years?  


If the answer is 'nothing else' then I do understand. I am just curious before I put all of my eggs in one basket with the coding idea. Even then, becoming a software developer with a background like that and not a second degree can look downright terrible I would think.",2019-03-25 02:44:07
How to get a job without a resume?,44,ahiy8q,"Hi,

I'm 30 and due to medical issues have never have a full time job, and have only held part-time jobs unsuccessfully.  I have recently figured out said medical issues and want to start a career of some kind.

My last employment was nearly 6 years ago.  For the last 2 years, I've been working on amazon's Mechanical Turk, essentially doing freelance work, but I struggle how to explain those skills to anyone.

I only have a high school diploma, and I don't have any references (I'm quite isolated).

I dread returning to retail, as it literally hurts my soul, but is that really the only way to get into the job market - to take a job no one else wants to build up proof that I'm now a reliable human being and then bail on that job as soon as something better comes along?

I'm just not sure where to start.  I don't know how to make a traditional resume when my last education was over 15 years ago, my last ""real"" job was 6 years ago, and I have a hodgepodge of skills that aren't easily explained on a resume.  I delivered newspapers, did home hemodialysis with my mother, watered plants at home depot, and answer surveys and do data crunching online.  All spread out over the last decade.

In a perfect world, I'd simply go to the company that I did hemo dialysis with my mother at, apply to be a tech, and have them hire me and train me.  Unfortunately, getting through their initial application process requires uploading your resume, and I'm not sure how to make one with my nontraditional course in life.

What are some options for a 52 year old woman?,45,9bypw2,"I posted this here yesterday and I didn't get any reply. I thought I would try again at an earlier hour in hopes I get some advice. It's really needed right now! I'll delete the previous one, and I'm sorry if I'm being an annoyance. 

Edit to add: any advice on what could be some business she could start as well maybe it would help? I think that right now starting a business is basically her only option. Just thinking what else other than fabrics can she do. 

TLDR: Mom is 52, got fired from long term job and has had a business for 4 years which will probably close down at the end of this year. She is educated, very intelligent. Looking for other options that will provide an income.

Okay, so I'm posting this here about my mom. A couple of disclaimers: we aren't in the US, or Europe, or the UK. Also, retirement here isn't about saving. I'll try to be as brief as possible and will add a tldr at the end. 

Long story short, my mom studied an undergrad in Economy, and also a specialization in something I don't remember (what comes before a master's, back in the day it was important but now it's nearly useless. Still a qualification). She is incredibly intelligent a smart and tenacious woman. She worked in a very huge company (the largest in the city, they oversee nearly all public resources) for like 20+ years but got fired because she didn't want to sleep with her boss. She sued but it all fell through. 

She lost the job when she was around 45 or so already no one would hire her due to her age. She was unemployed for some years until she got the chance to open a fabric store like all of my aunt's and uncles (Literally everyone is in the business). She's been on it for like 4 years, it was enough to keep her afloat also because she is very good with money but she also got into debt (she's been slowly playing) and my family members who promised to help her have also caused a lot of problems which now means she'll close down the business in December and will be out of a job apparently. She doesn't like this job, she only did it because it was her only option and she works without much problem because she has to but it's too stressful for how little reward it gives. 

So now I've been trying to look (and her too although she's focused right now in selling a lot of fabrics and having a smooth finish) what else she could do. I suggested teaching but it would require one year or so to get her certificate and she doesn't seem to be willing to do that without an income. We own the apparently we live in so no rent but the rest of utilities which is a lot. 

What else could she do that doesn't require so much education? I don't think the no education part is realistic but still worth it to ask. Also, there is a third option and is to use some money that she saved to not close the business down, move again and use that money to inject some capital in the business and keep at it. I don't agree about using that money, it's literally all she/we have (it's ultimately not my choice but she has asked for my opinion). We've been also thinking about what other business maybe she could start that would be better than this fabrics one. 

I just want her to be well. I'm unfortunately just a student in a particular situation undisclosed here who cannot do much, and I know she likes working, still is strong and has a lot of vitality. 

Any ideas are appreciated. Thank you for reading.

"How do I get out of sales and into something not quite as stressful, but still make a decent living?",41,8wln1m,"I created a new account so as not to let anyone think I'm trying to humblebrag, try to figure out who I am, or otherwise do anything but get advice.

I currently have a job that pays very well. I have a base salary of $110k and make commissions of around $110-150k on top of that. I work from home and travel to customers. I set my own hours and I have flexibility to go to my kids' school to see their performances, do whatever I want as long as I'm performing. Most people would think I have a dream job.

I thought I did too, until recently. Our company is going through a merger and our upper management is filled with absolute morons. For the last 6 months, they have turned our worlds upside down, and I am not making my commissions because of the new structure. It's so bad that they brought in a new CRO to run things, and he's basically reverting most of the changes that have been made. People are quitting left and right, and they just started laying people off.

Last year, while I was making a comfortable $250k, this year I'm basically living off my $110k. Don't get me wrong here either, $110k is a good living. I just relocated my family to a place with a lower cost of living so that I could start reducing my nut and contributing more to my retirement. However, I think I'd like to take a different approach, since I've lowered my nut maybe I could lower my income and be less stressed.

I spent the whole month of June in hotels and airplanes. Not literally, but I spent 3-4 nights a week in a different city. Even that didn't make me hit my numbers. I'm considered one of the better performers too. Only 4&#37; of the sales reps hit their number last month, so it's not like I'm out of the ""new ordinary"" here.

My problem is this: I've been in sales for the last 20 years. I have done all sorts of sales, but I don't know how to translate those skills into something else and package this up into something I can market toward a new career.

Where can I find jobs that will pay around what my base salary is, but without the stress of having to hit my impossible number every month? Without having to travel so often and be away from my family?

I know I probably won't be able to work from home, I know I won't get the flexibility I have now, but I think I'm ok with that. I've always been a top performer, and sadly even now in this new world they've created, I've closed more business than most and I'm still struggling. Every all-hands call we have is about how our company is failing financially, about how we're cutting costs, and how we need to sell more with fewer resources. I hate the direction our company is going and I just don't believe the company has a long-term plan for success.

The other problem is that sales, at least in my industry (software sales) is a high risk, high reward career. I've been laid off from two jobs even though I'm performing well. Being one of the higher paid reps at a company is great, until they need to cut costs. I need something more stable.

Thanks for any advice.

Tl;DR: What skills can I find in my sales resume that aren't about hitting my numbers?

Edit: Thanks for the comments so far. Just to be clear, I'm NOT trying to find a job that pays more than I make. I was simply asking for advice as to what skills I can take from my resume to look for a job that pays six figures. ",2018-07-06 19:49:25

Should I worry about telling my supervisor I am pursuing a position with another company? (Required step requested by prospective employer),44,8grvkj,"Hello Career Guidance!

So here’s the situation: I am interviewing at a one of the Big Four for a Human Capital consulting role. I’ve had a phone screening, a phone interview with a manager, and I have another phone interview scheduled for next week. The recruiter explained to me today that because my current employer is one of their clients (their auditor), I have to disclose I am pursuing a position with them to my current supervisor before they can extend an offer. She said this is a policy both companies have in place for hiring each other’s employees.  This will need to happen prior to the last step of an on-site interview, which obviously will be before they’ve made a decision about me. As you can probably imagine this could not go over well with my current employer, especially if I do not end up getting or accepting an offer for the new position.

7 advices I wish I knew when I joined a company,43,1nffut,"After leaving university, I already had a full time job in one of the biggest FMCG Company. I also had before some internships in different companies, industries and countries. Yet, it took me some time to understand what are the key principles which will help me to succeed in the company ladder. Maybe you are lucky to have a boss to tell you this from the very beginning, I wasn’t. I needed to learn those hard lessons myself. I want to share my lessons with everyone who hasn’t started career yet or wants to improve it.

1. This is your life and your career, so you are the one responsible for it.

Once I joined the company I failed into the illusion that if I will do a good job people will appreciate it, especially my boss. Nothing more wrong. Once you are hired, you are like a product – you need to promote yourself, you need to take care of the endorsements from relevant parties, check opinions especially that negative ones and be sure that you have sufficient amount of all of the actions.

2. Be proactive

You don’t need to have your own business, to be an entrepreneur. In reality, entrepreneurship is a state of mindset which is highly wanted in the companies. Every time you will come to your boss or simple propose and EXECUTE some new idea, project which will help your department, organization, boss, etc. you will get enormous credit. You will get incremental recognition of amazingly motivated and committed employee. Of course,  you cannot forget about advertising – spend sufficient amount of time promoting your project even before you start.

3. Know yourself

Be aware what you are good at, what is driving you, what is your passion. Try to find as many projects as possible which you can do with passion, as those will be those truly successful ones. If you don’t think about what you bring to the table, then you don’t get a seat there. On the other hand don’t be embarrassed to say “NO”. It is better than not delivering on time or at all. People will rather understand “NO” then broken promise.

4. Develop your emotional intelligence and soft skills.

Soft skills include positive attitude, team work, ability to handle conflicts, interpersonal communication, negotiation. According to research for 61% of managers they are even more important than hard skills. Try to work on those skills, check available trainings, ask for feedback. The higher you will go on the corporate ladder the more you will need those skills.

5. Help your boss.

”You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” – Zig Ziglar, Secrets of Closing the Sale. This is especially true with your manager. The more supportive, helpful and open for feedbacks and his/her needs you will be the better chance for reward in promotion, salary increase or other opportunities. Managers are the closest to us and have the biggest influence, therefore, instead of thinking only how you can succeed think how you can help your boss succeed.

6. Find out what is hot

Companies are like Fashion Shows – each year you have new trends and collections. One year it is important to focus on market share, other year ROI or digital media spending. There is always some topic which is hot and trending, and this is the one you should focus. Don’t go to any other direction before you know everything about the new trend and you use it regularly. Don’t go against the crowd – if everyone is wearing red and blue you will simply look like weird wearing any other color…

7. Be the expert. Be well known!

Be the expert 9-5 and then go more mile – attend conferences, events, meetups or any other events to learn more and to connect with co-workers. You will be able to learn, develop relationships and have more to talk about at the office. Remember – people are hiring and promoting people not tables and numbers.

Should I leave my current full-time position for a temporary part-time job that might advance my career?,44,byr8w1,"Hi.


I am currently in a role in my organization that is fairly complex and always busy, but relatively underappreciated. It's very much a jack of all trades coordinator position that lets me collaborate with a lot of different work groups without ever being the lead on any initiatives. I've been with the company for about 7 years and moved into my current role 2 years ago after a few years as an analyst and 1 year as an intern.


In terms of pay, I've been making the same wage for the past couple years with a lot of the opportunities for advancement in other positions passing me by because I haven't had as broad a range of experience as other internal candidates. 


I will be interviewing for a new role in a different branch of the company that would allow me to lead a research project and gain some project management experience. The catch is the position is temporary for 1 year and only part-time. So, while the pay is much higher than what I currently make, I would be earning half as much with the reduced hours. My hope is that if I took on this new part-time role, I could spend the rest of my time taking classes or an online program to give me more of an edge once this limited term position ends. 


So...how much of a risk am I taking here? I feel like I've played it conservative for the past few years by sticking around and grinding for the decent steady income, but I'm worried I risk being seen as unambitious by management. I don't want to be treated like a fixture in my current role who the hiring teams don't consider for advancement. 


For context: I'm in my early 30s and have been saving money for a downpayment for the past few years. I live with my partner who will help with covering expenses in the meantime, but I won't be able to contribute to the house fund during this time.

"As an adult college student, what are some jobs that are flexible with school schedules and to able offer benefits like health insurance?",45,bemce6,"A little backstory of my experience... Sorry for so many ""I's"".

I got my associate's degree in Business from a community college in 2012 and said I'm never going back to college...

I worked for over 7 years in car dealerships and banks full-time until I decided to enroll part-time in a finance program at a state university. I realized part-time would take a lot longer to graduate than I initially expected. I will be full-time at school this fall semester going forward and I plan to finish all of my classes by fall 2020. 

A major issue is that my university is a regional campus and offers literally, 1 course at 1 time slot only once a semester. The limited class availability is what's throwing my job search for a loop. It's bullshit.

I've been thinking a lot about what companies would offer a 40 hr work week with flexibility, decent pay (around $14/hr), and health insurance until I finish my degree. I have considered coffee chains like SB and DD, but I have a little bit of shame going down in my career after making over $30k for the last 5 years of my life.

I really appreciate any input!

Thanks,

I missed an important detail during contract negotiation and got their written offer. Is it possible to negotiate before I sign the offer??,44,az3nyg,"I (31F) was offered a position I was really interested in, at a low salary but that was OK for me since it is in the non-profit sector. I verbally agreed to it thinking it was a 35 hours a week position. HR sent me the written document for me to sign and I realized it was a 40 hours a week position. That changes everything for me, since that would drop the hourly rate really low. I know I should have confirmed with them beforehand, that is on me ;) 

What is the best way to navigate this? I hesitate between refusing the offer, taking it and looking for something else at the same time, playing dumb and telling them I assumed it was 35 hours, etc. ",2019-03-09 15:48:52
"Interviewing for my ""dream"" company, HR becomes unresponsive. What should I do?",44,aklvlk,"Hey guys, how are you doing?

So, back in the begining of December I applied at this big company for a technical position (IT), it took them 5 minutes to get back to me and do the first screening and schedule a second interview with the area's Director.

My second interview happened at the 18th of December and it went well. It was a nice conversation where I saw a lot of potential to develop myself and be a good employee there. The Director was also interested in my profile since it overlaps a bit with a couple of other areas and this would help speeding things up on a daily basis. By the end of the interview, he told me about a third interview (technical) and how much he wanted to finish the hiring process before the end of 2018.

The only instructions given after that were that I should wait for a feedback and then schedule the third interview.

Up to this day, I have no feedback whatsoever. The HR guy responsible for my profile is ghosting me and always promises a deadline that's never met. But he's always ensuring me that I'm still on the run and their online HR system also confirms that.

This whole thing has become quite confusing and frustrating. I have been facing a good amount of anxiety because of that, actually.

It would be great to work there, but don't know how much further should I still insist. Also, I'm amused about how messy the organisation looks like from this point of view...

What do you guys think?

"Tariffs hitting my workplace hard, how soon should I leave?",44,a5u437,"Hi folks,

I work as a salesperson at a small business that middleman's goods from China to USA based companies. Well the Trump China tariffs just hit yesterday and our business is being hit with an additional 25% tax on goods we import (on top of the 4.5% already in place). This is basically all of our profit. The owners seem optimistic in trying to negotiate our suppliers to take some of the blow along with raising prices and slicing our commission percentage. I'm not too mad because my base pay is more than I personally would make elsewhere right now. Business was already slow to begin with and I strongly believe the price hikes on our customers will kill our business.  I've only worked here 3 1/2 months.

What to do with my life?,40,a5apjd,"Mom kinda influenced me indirectly to pursue medicine. I was naturally good at chemistry, biology, physiology, etc. So I ended up working towards a university degree in Biomed. Sciences. I'm now here in the middle of third year realizing that med school ain't meant for everyone (sorry for the grammar, I'm starting to use that word even as a Canadian Lol). I got a 3.8+ GPA (not to brag), but I'm starting to feel very incompetent in my skill set and also feeling a sense of insecurity in my future career. The problem is, I don't know what else to do that interests me after my bachelors. 

&#x200B;

I begin to think that I may have bipolar disorder, or even anti-social/borderline personality disorder. I sometimes act so enthusiastically and immediately go into a state of sadness and isolation from everyone (including my family). I had become engrossed by making a ton of money in my future career in 2nd year (whatever that may be). Now I'm beginning to think otherwise. That I won't find a job. Or create a job. 

&#x200B;

And it's taking a toll on my grades as well. I just feel so fucking pissed at myself sometimes on how I can't make up my mind on my career. I look at doing research post-undergrad and it bores the hell out of me. I think of something professional like optometry or dentistry but I've got to pay more money for these tests (I've done the MCAT already). I don't even have any extracurriculars except volunteering weekly at my community hospital since grade 9. I just can't seem to form relationships, or engage in social discourse with several people. If I have to engage in social conversation, I become extremely cynical of everyone around me, and from that, arrogance sprouts. I can't display arrogance of course, because it would hurt my reputation among the people. 

&#x200B;

And I feel that's what bars me from making my goals. I had the goal of becoming a great scientist in first year (bad GPA then). Then filthy rich and powerful in my second year (unable to form social relationships like a normal person). Now I'm halfway done 3rd year and I'm pissed as fuck. I'm just so lost now. I have a fear that I wouldn't be able to do anything after my undergrad. I've learned a lot from this undergrad, including how the body works, how chemicals interact, how to do biotechnology research with principles I've learned in multiple labs. Now it bores the fuck out of me thinking if I have to do the same thing for the rest of my life as a possible researcher in the future.

I want to help the environment but I didn't get a degree in STEM - career suggestions?,42,9fop0b,"As the title states - I'm deeply invested in the problem of climate change and the state of the environment, and I want a career that directly works on those issues.

Any tips on changing mindset and combating impostor syndrome while applying for jobs?,43,8ffkfi,"Unemployed at the moment and two years out of school.  Networking and applying for jobs both trigger a lot of psychotic self-loathing that I would love to.. not experience.  On paper I have the talents, credentials and experience.

I actually have spoken about this with at least four therapists in two different cities and they all seem pretty uninterested.  My feeling is that this is more of a life-coaching/ career coaching problem that they don't feel trained or obligated to help with.  Or maybe I've had bad luck.

Either way, I would be delighted to hear some thoughts on the subject.

How can I cover up these employment gaps that happened due to mental illness?,45,7cbzne,"This started back in 2015. I got a job at a call center that I thought i would like. Unfortunately at the time, I did not realize that I had major anxiety and severe depression. Due to the constant rude , screaming customers, micromanagement, and bad management, I lasted only 10 months.

So I ended up at another job, which I actually liked(not on the phones yay!) but 10 months into it, I ended up with a medical condition where I could not type(it was tennis elbow and a lot of the job was data entry) and so I got fired, but I was on workman's comp, for two months, so I stretched it out on my resume to one year, and say that I was a independent contractor since it looks weird that i was at one job for 10 months, and then another for 10 months.

Which leads me to today. I am at another call center, I am on better meds, but I have come to the realization that call center work is not for me. I hate my job, the constant micromanagement and rude, screaming in my ear customers really get on my nerves. I had someone threaten to kill me last week, and today I find out that my shift is changing where I get off at 11, and have to be back here at 7 am. Although I warned management this might happen and they said that they would look into it last week, when i told them today what had happened, they told me that they wish they could have sympathy for me, but they had to do it when their schedule changed, and they just told me to ""roll with it"". To make matters even worse, some of the management from my first job, got hired on here at my latest job! So now i feel like I am working at Job 1 pt 2..instead of starting off fresh somewhere...

So my question is this. How do I cover up these ""bad jobs""? I have a MPA and I volunteer at a non profit in my spare time, and I have been there for 2 months already. I plan on putting that job on my resume for sure. I have heard of people either say to put ""consultant"" which I guess I could say that I was a non profit consultant, but I feel like that is unbelievable. A friend of mine told me that I could put his business down for a year, but i would have to write that i was a intern for his medical practice so no one would ask me how much I made or w2s. So that covers up 1 year, but I can't just leave that one there. So I can either put myself down as a consultant, or I thought about making my own business(with a free template website) and put that down as ""experience"", though tbh, I don't know if that will work either. Can you guys give me some advice please? I need help. Thanks.",2017-11-12 01:58:45

Dealing with a toxic workplace and boss. I’ve got golden handcuffs and have been looking internally but so far no luck. Advice on next steps?,43,b4sxve,"I work for a big company. They pay me incredibly well and I have a sizable amount of RSUs waiting to vest. My first two years at this company were amazing thanks to an incredible boss and the work I was doing.

He was ousted in a political coup recently.

Now, I work for the most psychotic boss I have ever encountered who is constantly tearing me down and making me feel little on a daily basis. She lies, throws me under the bus, misrepresents me to leadership to make herself appear better, constantly criticizes my work, never has positive feedback, gossips about everyone at work, inconsistently moves goal posts on assignments AFTER they’re turned in (so she can criticize), etc. It has been demoralizing working under her.

She has isolated me from the rest of the team and I have no one to turn to.

I’ve been encouraged to look internally for roles, but so far, I haven’t had any luck...and quite frankly I don’t think I want to work for a company that allows this stuff to happen.

The problem is manyfold:

1) I am highly paid and have quite a bit of unvested RSUs. I know it will be incredibly difficult to find another company that pays as well.

2) I’m in the middle of a career crisis. I don’t want to continue doing what I was doing for work and I’m exploring other opportunities in different fields. This has made the internal search more difficult as I’ve been told I don’t have the experience for roles in other fields.

3) I have not started looking externally in earnest yet. I’m at the breaking point where every day I go into work, my mental health takes a huge toll. This is not sustainable.

So what should I do? Am I fool for leaving all that money and searching externally? Should I really be looking at possibly starting a career change while looking  to get out of my current company? Or should I focus on getting out ASAP by looking for  something at another company similar to what I’ve been doing and take the pay cut?

Job is potentially on the line. Frustrated / Worried. I mostly have general office skills. Next move recommendations?,43,9u76bx,"Hello, everyone. Today is 11/4/2018. **tl;dr on the bottom if you want.**

**Context:**

* From January to May, I applied to 160+ jobs and eventually landed one. 
* I started my administrative assistant job back in late June. My first serious full time job, prior was retail.
* I knew the scheduling end of the job, but also have to do data collection, accounting, ordering, and many other things which I have never done.
* I had a 3 month job assessment in early October. 
* It was negative, I would give the rating I received a D+ or C-. 
* This put me on job probation and my next review is in two months after early October, meaning my next review is in the first week of January
* The office is shut down for the final week of December and Thanksgiving weekend. 
* This means I have less than two months left. About 35 work days left.

**Why did I do poorly on the review? My supervisor stated that:**

* I panic too quickly. When faced with an unknown situation that suddenly hits me, I'm enduced to panic. (This is not hysterical panicking, but you can tell I'm panicky)
* I'm not independent enough
* I don't collaborate / engage with my coworkers and out of department coworkers enough.
* I make repeat mistakes.
* He does not repeating things. 
* I'm a slow learner.
* I'm forgetful.

Honestly, I think the last four things are false, those things happened very little or should be expected because I'm completely new to a lot of things and they know that. I have taken steps to fix all of these. . He has only yelled at me 4 times, but I notice they're over small repeat questions or mistakes, I notice a tendency to fixate on small mistakes at make. **This has made be a bit cautious  and anxious around my supervisor, to the point where the other the other day I made a repeat mistake and got yelled by my supervisor and he mentioned that he knows I'm scared of him and ""that we should fix this"".** 

&#x200B;

**I'm not scared of him, I'm scared of the potential job search. But at the same time, my supervisor has found me a mentor from another department and wants me to improve. So I'm not entirely sure of my position right now.**

There are things that work in my favor of my longevity and things that don't.

&#x200B;

**GOOD**

* Someone else is leaving next month. This means they will be two down if they take me out in January.
* My role is important and I'm used to it now. 
* My supervisor wants me to succeed (I think..) and wants us not to be awkward with each other
* The office likes me. Only one I have an awkward relationship with is my supervisor.

**BAD**

* My supervisor is nitpicky and very critical.
* I have a short amount of time to improve.
* I can't get a feel if my supervisor likes me or not
* Supervisor might feel that its too late to fix our relationship some how.

**Steps I'm taking to fix this my standing**

* Setting up more meetings
* Talking with people more
* Communicating with the most detail and as thorough as possible even if they don't need it.
* Checklists for everything
* Working during lunch and on the weekend to show increased output (though I obviously to can't tell my boss this)
* Finishing more tangible projects
* Asking other coworkers questions instead of him
* Finding ways to fix anxiety, like stretching and more sleep

**Do you think I have a chance?**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**tl;dr**

**I started a new job 4 months ago, had a job eval last month, did poorly and my job is on the line first week of January.** Highly critical boss at my office job gave me bad review. Boss wants me to success (I think). I find out if I get the ax in January. I'm taking strong action to fix my standing at the workplace. With my job at stake and a possible bump in my career that makes my resume look like I skip from job to job, I'm unsure of what to do. Here are some questions I have.

* Have you survived job probation? And how?
* What kind of jobs should I apply to just in case? (For reference, I'm in Western Massachusetts - North Connecticut area)
* What skills should I develop in my free time to help my resume / portfolio? 

My skills include office equipment, some IT, customer service, scheduling, receptionist work, low level accounting (invoices, purchase orders, etc.), ordering items, catering, adobe spark, and like okay knowledge of Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop. I have mostly retail and office experience.  Personality wise I'm ambitious, pretty patient and like to develop new skills, particularly want to make youtube videos and learn e-commerce and secondary income.

I am an overpaid but unhappy software engineer. Should I quit to do a PhD?,41,9aer0d,"**Current Situation:** I'm 26 and work in the US at a large tech company as a software engineer, where I've been for two years. The job is reasonably easy/low stress and the pay is good, but I don't really feel fulfilled (possibly because my non-work life is essentially non-existent).

**Proposal:** I want to make a change, and one of my ideas is to go back to school to do a PhD in a computer-science-y field to get more into research, which I imagine might be more enjoyable than what I'm doing now.

**Pros:**

1. I see job postings for Research Scientist positions that appeal to me more than my current work, but have a PhD and published research papers listed as requirements -- a PhD would open up this kind of work as an option.
2. Going back to school sounds like a nice change of pace, and I'd hopefully be able to make some friends and have a less mindless lifestyle.
3. The academic work would let me dip my toe into computer science research and decide whether it's actually more fulfilling than what I'm doing now or just a greener-grass scenario.

**Cons:**

1. I feel there's a significant risk that this isn't a large enough change to make me happy (e.g. I could instead try to hack it as a stand-up comedian or start a sandwich shop).
2. Large investment of both time (>4 years) and money (>$1M lost compensation).
3. It's possible that a PhD wouldn't actually give me any opportunities I wouldn't have after the same amount of time spent in industry.

**Prior advice:**

I'm getting conflicting suggestions from the people I've talked to about this:

* My brother (who has a PhD but now works in industry) told me not to bother going back to school and to just keep doing what I'm doing.
* My master's advisor told me I should definitely get a PhD at some point for the experience of going deep into a problem.
* The rest of my family says I should do whatever makes me happy (which I'd do if I could).

Any perspective would be appreciated!

I worked their for about 2 years, and then I decided to quit when I could't deal with that mind\-numbing job. I was good at what I did, but I just hated that work. 

So I learnt about Digital Marketing, and joined a Digital Marketing and Web Design & Development Agency as a Digital Marketing Executive. I did SEO and Social Media Marketing out there for around 3 months when I already started getting bored with that shit too. After 3 months, the CEO offered me a Business Development Executive Position, and I thought why not \- let's give it a shot as well. 

Now, it has been around 2 years since I have been working as a BD. There are some parts of the job that I like \(e.g. Consulting Clients\) and some parts that I hate, and I am pretty good at what I do. But at the end of the day I just don't fill fulfilled. I have been thinking for quite some time to quit this job too, but as I have grown older, it has become extremely difficult for me to make that call. 

But last week, I finally decided \- I am gonna quit. So I dropped the bomb on my Manager last week  \(I switched to a new Agency last December and they had no clue I was thinking about quitting\) \- and he was taken aback. I told him that I was not feeling fulfilled by the work I do, and I have no clue what I will be doing now. He said I would be really good in Marketing and that I should manage the Marketing department of our Agency along with a little bit of BD work. 

So I am confused whether I should take this opportunity or not. 

Also, I am not able to see myself working in a Corporate Environment in the long run, but I don't know if there is any other way to make my ends meet.

The bottom line is that I am 26 and I don't know what to do with my life. I sometimes wonder maybe I am overthinking and this is how everyone must feel. So I am wondering if anyone can explain me how to handle this shit. 

Also, let me give you a brief description of what kind of a person I am. I was born with zero talents\(like singing, dancing, painting, etc.\). The only good thing that I have is that I am hardworking and I am obsessive about being the best at thing I do. This is the only thing that helps me become fairly good at whatever I do. 

I have got an analytical mind, and I am good with logical reasoning stuff. But I like creative things a lot, and I feel I have zero creativity \(I suck at music, writing, painting and that kind of stuff\). 

So I would love to hear your suggestions on how I can find a work that is fulfilling?

TLDR: I am 26 and I don't know what to do with my life.",2018-05-13 14:21:49
Any other Jacks of all trades find luck with careers they don't hate?,43,88wf8m,"So, currently I work as ""data analyst"" that does not actually do any analyzing of data. I consider myself pretty apt at doing a variety of tasks; from building drywall, to installing electrical conduit, to setting up network firewalls, to making a filet mignion, to building some software code, to repairing a broken car strut, to taking manual blood pressure readings, to customer service, etc. I don't know where to turn to get good ideas about what careers to pursue. Of the two requirements I have, I fear that I don't have the necessary experience to land a job that fulfills both desires: have variety in day-to-day tasks, and not be a 21st slave (like I am now). I had the option of either accepting the job as a ""data analyst"" where I thought I would be able to learn about data handling and whatnot (but I didn't), a police officer, or a nuclear reactor operator. (yes, no pattern whatsoever). Has anyone else been in similar conundrums and found a job that makes them happy?

A new promotion but EXTREME pressure. How can i tell my manager without sounding unworthy to the promotion?,41,bmhorx,"Hi everyone. About 2 months ago i got promoted to a higher role in my team. That role belonged to my coworker who had me and another person assisting him with the role.
It was luck for me that they decided to promote us both. Him to another role and for me to take his role. I was promised to be able to hire someone to help me as well but because of budget that has been canceled. Even the person who was assisting with the job before is not there anymore so i have 0 support and the role is VERY time limited with due dates and systems not working as such. 
I’m spending more and more time at work. I dont take breaks anymore. Even going to the bathroom or getting water is like a big break for me. I work weekends and during public holidays, and on top of it all, its ramadan and im fasting. Im so stressed that even sleep paralysis has returned to me.
Im very stressed. When i work from home, i spend hours working while crying at the same time.
I spoke with my manager before but i didnt tell him how bad it is so nothing has changed. Everyone had such great expectations for me and how ill be even better than the previous person while much younger and climb the ladder etc etc, but im starting to doubt it.
How can i approach my manager without being unworthy for this role? I dont want him to think that i dont deserve it because honestly i know i deserve it. I just need help",2019-05-09 12:41:49

Should i pursue an MBA or MS Engineering after almost 2 years of experience in the industry?,41,b4hkws,"Background: I am currently working in the telecom industry since the last 2 years in the CORE department as an engineer. I am qualified as an EE with a major in Computer Engineering. I somehow ended up working in the communications field as a network & telecom engineer and now i feel that im ready for graduate education. The thing here is that i am not really sure which path to pursue keeping in view my current credentials & past experiences. I am still sour from the workload in EE and the struggles i had to go through in my bachelor's that i just dread studying engineering again particularly at a graduate level and i feel an MBA would be much more easier to handle with a job but the financial aspect of it is a bit offsetting as an MS in EE/CS/CE is much more affordable than an MBA.

I am here at a major cross road in life . On one end i think that pursuing a masters in engineering again might offset the bachelor's experience and will have a chance to prove myself again academically, on the other hand i feel to just go in something totally different academically ex. MBA and try my luck in it but i have to be practical and see the end goal rather than just my feelings/whims.",2019-03-23 13:12:40

What do you do with a Bachelors in Psychology?,42,8sqx4i,"Hi,
I'm considering going back to school and actually finishing my degree in psychology. I am already halfway through the program, but I stopped going for years.

I'm tired of doing shitty laborous jobs such as in restaurant kitchens and warehouses to live paycheck to paycheck. I see going back to college as a way to take a break from all of that, engage myself intellectually , and meet some beautiful women. 

I have worked as a line cook for a few years and even began to go to culinary school, although I only did a semester, I absolutely loved it. I do not however see myself being happy in the restaurant business. The life of a restaurant cook is unappealing to me for the long hours, dinner rushes, heat, pressure, lack of communication with the outside world, lack of benefits, low pay etc 

Right now I'm a package handler at FedEx ground, working third shift. The money is really good, but I cant do this for much longer. You get hurt, and it can be stressful sometimes needing to make your production quota. I enjoy the work culture there and that I have weekends and holidays off unlike the restaurant business.

I know I am not a technical/math minded person and would not be a fit for engineering, chemistry or computer science majors.

I would like to hear from people who have graduated and what types of jobs/field they are working in. My primary interest is more on the lines of neuroscience, neuropsychology, biofeedback, psychoacoustics, and experimental/research. I dont feel like going to graduate school, at least for a long time. 

But if going to back college wont get me out of this , then should I even bother? :/",2018-06-21 13:58:48

I'm 40 and my job is likely disappearing next year - what should I do next?,43,7qcidq,"I was a professional violinist and violin teacher for 10 years, but when the recession hit in 2008 I lost everything - arts funding dried up, most people couldn't afford violin lessons, etc.

then I took out a massive amount of student loans to get a masters in occupational therapy. I've been earning enough to keep a roof over my head, but despite all the hype about it being a ""hot job"" in high demand, i haven't been able to get anything more than on-call and temp/contract work for the past 4 years. 

Now there are changes to the Medicare payment system coming in 2019 that will likely decimate the demand for OTs. we just had a meeting with a rep from corporate where she said we should prepare for job cuts when this new system is implemented, and that we should all ""have a plan B"". 

I'm terrified of being nearly 40 and starting over yet again, and I legitimately have no idea what I can do to earn income. I also have learning disabilities, and it seems like the only things I am capable of doing are over-saturated with competitors and/or low-paying.

I've thought about trying to teach violin again, but I sold my violin and haven't played since the recession/homelessness fiasco, and I'm afraid to try re-investing time and money in getting back to a level where I could teach, only to find out it's just as hard to earn income teaching music as it was in 2008?

I've also tried (and failed) two programming bootcamps and a data analytics program.  

I've considered getting Pilates certification (kind of related to therapy background, and maybe my degree would be an asset/useful?), but again- over-saturated market due to relatively low cost/time investment to get certified (and studios flooding the market with instructors because teacher trainings are a cash cow for the studios.)

I am unable to form meaningful relationships at work - how can I be more likable?,40,bi9u3h,"HI guys

I work a regular 9 to 5. It's been 5 years since I have been there and for a while now it is apparent that I am unable to form meaningful relationships at work. People never invite me for lunch or for drinks after work. Even when I try to organize something, people seem not that interested to join.

At this point I feel my best option is to seek new employment that will allow me better flexibility to get my degree. Maybe that means part time, maybe it’s a remote work from home position... but since I feel that my experience alone isn’t going to be valued properly, I’m not left with many options to get my confidence up for interviews and applications.

I think the sun is setting on my illustration career and I don't know exactly what to do?,42,9scccl," 

This is a lot to unpack, so please bear with me. Since I was a kid, I was always good at drawing. I always used to draw my favorite characters like Mario and Sonic when I was a kid in the 90s. I'm a very good draftsman, you would say. I can copy things I see really well, and with planning, can create some pretty effective illustrations. I've been working off and on as a freelance illustrator for 10 years. I'm 32 years old, male, and currently living in Florida with my wife. We just moved here about a month ago. She just gained a job, so our money situation is probably better than it's been in quite some time. I have some illustration work that will pay off in about 6 weeks, hopefully.

The thing is, I've never been able to support myself or my wife with my art. Even before I met her, I was limping along, gaining most of my income from teaching at a local sip and paint. I've had glimmers of success with my art, but nothing compared to some of my colleagues who have built careers around their art. I don't know if I've ever really made over $20,000 in a year just through my illustration and painting work.

And that isn’t to say that I’m not busy. I feel like I work really hard. My agency gets me jobs that just don’t pay very well, so my dollar per hour ratio is likely quite bad. They also have terrible pay schedules, so there have been times where I’ve worked my ass off, only to wait 3 months to get paid $1,300 or something like that.

What I’ve really had to give in to here, is that I’ve been doing this for TEN YEARS. Why is this status quo acceptable to me? Because it helps me fit into the pre-ordained bubble that I've fit in since I was a kid? Because my mom always envisioned that I would be an artist? I graduated in 2008, and I barely have better prospects than I did 10 years ago. The only extra feather in my cap is that I’ve done some light graphic design and social media work, but the only thing that REALLY does for me is make my portfolio look unfocused. No one can look at my portfolio (see here: [**https://tinyurl.com/y84h6j23**](https://tinyurl.com/y84h6j23)**)**and have any idea what they’re hiring me for. No one can really know what they’re going to get by hiring me.

This is likely why I’ve fallen into the role of a copy artist with my agency. Since I don’t really have my own style, I often take over projects for other artists, using their styles. There seems to be work available, but it just pays horribly. I just had to turn down a job because it likely would’ve taken me 3 weeks straight to make around $1,300, and I know I really couldn’t do much else at the same time. At that point, I might as well start working at Target or something.

I’ve read so many stories about how “not to quit,” or “never give up,” but I just don’t know if these platitudes work well in my case. Have I been banging my head against the wall expecting the same results for 10 years? I have never quite felt that I’ve fit in with fellow artists. I don’t wake up and need to sketch, and honestly I haven’t kept a sketchbook since I was a kid. I had sketchbooks when I was in college, but it was hard not to when you were in art school. I can see plainly that my passion to create drawings and paintings is nothing compared to people who do this work successfully.

But then the problem comes in...what the hell else am I supposed to do? I can work Photoshop and Illustrator in my sleep, and I DO feel fulfilled when I make original creations. I’m not sketching my drink in my sketchbook during dinner, but I’ve gone on tangents where I’ve prioritized side projects over main projects. I have fun making fun images based on my favorite characters. These moments, however, feel few and far between. I hit high highs and low lows when it comes to my energy for this.

Last year, I took a job at a bank and had a pretty severe identity crisis. I wound up quitting after 6 weeks, and it remains one of the biggest failures in my life. I quickly returned to the idea of freelance illustration and sip and paint instruction, only to realize that I’m just not going to make the kind of money or grow the way I’d like to, personally. It felt like I was returning to an addiction of some sorts, trying to get a high off of something that clearly wasn't delivering it.

I know intellectually that doing something else does not preclude me from creating art in my spare time. One of the happiest times in my life was when I spent weeks learning some basic game development. I mean, honestly, if I could do that every day, I think I’d be pretty fulfilled. But that was just a hobby. Maybe I only loved it because it was new for me. Maybe I do have a passion for coding and game development? Who knows. That's kind of a big rabbit hole to go down at the age of 32.

I think my goal for now is to find some interests of mine that I’m even tangentially interested in. Computers, technology, using creativity, I really don’t know. I’ve never envisioned myself doing anything else other than making pictures, to be honest. I just really don’t know exactly what I want to be doing, and it’s pretty scary. I suppose the best thing to do is to provide myself options so I don't feel like ""I HAVE TO DO ILLUSTRATION OR DESIGN OR I WILL DIE BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND FULFILLMENT IN ANYTHING ELSE.""

There are so many questions going on in my head. If I stop being an “illustrator,” have the last 10+ years of my life been a waste? How do I learn to identify myself if not by my job? How can I do another job without thinking my life is over? I really just want to be able to just “be” and take some job, any job, while I use nights to figure out what it is I might really want to do. Thankfully, I do have art work that keeps me working through the beginning of November, and some work that goes to the end of July. I have to finish 2 more books for Scholastic during that time, so whatever I AM doing, I need to be doing that at nights and on weekends.

I’m just very tired of:

1. Getting paid peanuts to do unfulfilling work
2. Getting paid 3 months after I finished said work
3. Crossing my fingers that my agent will find me work soon
4. Turning down work because I can’t tell if I’ll have enough time to do it
5. Using work as a band-aid with no security

I wonder if I’d be having this discussion if I was paid more. Maybe I would. But all I do know is that whatever I’m doing...is not working. It’s really hard on me, and it’s especially hard on my wife, who wants to see me grow and to be able to help provide for us. She said that watching me attempt to further my illustration career has been like watching a battered housewife continually go back to a relationship that is toxic to her. She doesn’t deny that I have some decent work, but it pains her to see me work so hard and not see the results I deserve, when she knows I deserve much more for the work I do.

I don’t know if I’m looking for guidance or just a place to vent, but part of me is kind of feeling like the sun is setting on my art career. I don’t particularly have an interest in having to completely rebrand myself or create X amount of new pieces for my portfolio, especially not while I don’t have a ‘backup plan’ in place. It’s kind of like...I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for. And maybe that’s okay. Like I said before, I think I really need to learn how to just “be,” because I’m so tired of being anxious and being stuck in my head all the time.",2018-10-29 14:45:55
"I am a new nurse but i have a strong interest in pursuing medicine, is it worth the time commitment?",42,9o5jt3,"Hello everyone. Please correct me if this is not the right forum to ask this question. 

I am a new nurse (only been a nurse for 3 months), but I’ve been left with the feeling of wanting to pursue medicine instead. I’ve had medicine in the back of my head since I graduated high school. I chose nursing because I thought I’d enjoy the direct patient care more than only seeing patients for 20 minutes like doctors often do. (Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy nursing and love the work I do. But I can’t see myself 10 years from now being a nurse). 

Anyways, I’ve been back and forth between nursing, nurse practitioner, and MD/DO. The ONLY thing holding me back is residency. I see how hard the residents work and how OFTEN they work. It’s insane and as someone who needs a lot of sleep, I’m very intimidated. The only thing keeping me from NP is the lack of autonomy. 

If you could offer any advice that would be great. I’d like to have a decision by July. 
Thanks. ",2018-10-14 22:27:30

"Trying to make a living WITHOUT a conviction, but a record none the less?",39,970lrf,"Two years ago I was (unjustly) fired and arrested from my (pubic office position) place of employment of 3 years.  My case was dropped from a felony to a misdemeanor, adjudication was withheld by a judge, and the case was closed.  I have NO other criminal history, at all; not even driving/speeding tickets.  I hold a bachelor's degree and several certifications ranging from medical to psychology, and I've had a steady, respectable job history = I'm a qualified, capable individual.  

In those 2 years since my life came crashing down in a matter of seconds, I've been offered at least 5 decent employment positions, however as soon as a background check is completed, the offers have been rescinded.  To be honest, every one of these companies has conveniently disappeared and no longer answers emails and phone calls.  (I realize that's a bad sign in in of itself, but a job is a job at this point) I have never lied about this unfortunate event, and I am upfront when asked.  I've also offered the information on my own accord at times, with the same outcome.  I cannot get my history expunged or sealed at this time (from what I can tell), as it's only been 2 years.

"29, BA (English Major), in ok marketing job. Planning to go back for a Masters. Best shot at a well-paying career? Trying to explore schooling options.",40,b68m8r,"EDIT: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE RESPONSES, going through them all now. Really appreciate y'all taking time to share your experiences!

Hi everyone, to keep things brief I'm going to start with a point form summary of where I'm at right now:

* Graduated with a Major in English from a top Canadian university (mediocre GPA), taught abroad for a gap year and came back
* Did my LSAT and got an okay score (164) but didn't end up going to law school because when I looked into it more it didn't appeal to me. 
* Ended up as a freelance writer for the paper, did a post-grad college cert in marketing and got a fair paying job (especially with bonuses, but inconsistent) that is in the 55k-70k range with no room for further development; this is where I've been working for the last couple years
* No debt
* Current plan is to go back for my masters of science in business analytics (perhaps abroad) and then to find a job wherever I end up doing my masters.

So at the moment I'm studying for the GRE to prep my applications. Something that's nagging at me is that I obviously have no analytics/math background and I want to have a back-up option in case this falls through. I'd like to be making over 100k a year. What kind of options do I realistically have? For example, I've seen Technical Writing pop up a few times in discussions here when English majors are mentioned. I don't mind not loving what I do -- having money will let me continue with the hobbies and enjoyments I have in life. 

My main question is what I should go back to school for? I'm keen about Business Analytics since it's interesting for me, seems like there's a lot of development in the field and lots of flexibility in terms of how many industries need/will need it.

Tl;DR: English Major turned marketing guy trying to do a career change, trying to figure out what my career options are to make $100k+/yr, and what other programs I can think about other than Business Analytics that's perhaps a bit less of a farfetched switch.

I have two job offers on the table and I am in complete analysis paralysis - Which is the best option?,35,a42iyx,"I understand that it is a really great problem to have and I am very grateful that I am in this predicament.

I left my job as a marketing data analyst to pursue a career I really think I'd enjoy (data management). It has been two months, give or take, and I finally have two offers after about 8 interviews.

Details:

**Offer #1: Large Health & Wellness Retailer - Senior Analyst**

Salary: $90k per year, good benefits, OK commute (not far but live near NYC so it's traffic-heavy)

The team seems AMAZING. I absolutely loved everyone I spoke to/have been speaking to. I got maybe ONE weird vibe from someone, but out of 8 people, that's not bad at all.

The work itself was what I was trying to steer away from - It's digital analytics and I found that I'm not really passionate about it. Can I do it? Sure. But will I love it? Maybe not. However -- that salary is not one to be ignored, and I know I'd be using a couple of skills I have been wanting to really dig into (SQL & Python combined). I also think the work-life balance will be not that great and I am not confident the company is very organized. My last position was INCREDIBLY disorganized and chaotic, and I was trying to steer clear of that.

&#x200B;

**Offer #2: Fortune 50 Company - Logistics & Transportation - Data Repository Analyst**

Salary: $70k per year, plus bonus incentive program & merit raises, benefits are nothing out of the ordinary (and I get paid monthly instead of bi-weekly), commute would be further but less traffic

The building is all IT people. It's an IT headquarters, and I have been wanting to switch to IT for a VERY long time. The work is exactly what I want to be doing, minus the fact that I won't be using SQL and Python much, if at all. However, everything else about the job seems great. The team? I like them, and I know I'd work fine with them.. but I liked the other company's team better in terms of personalities.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: My heart is telling me to go with Offer #2 because it's the work I've been trying to get into, but my brain is telling me to go with Offer #1 because $$$$ and it's a senior position, and I love the team. Which is the best choice for my career?

How Do You Know When It's Time To Switch Jobs?,35,9l2f9o,"Hello. This is my first time making a post of this nature so bear with me. I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this. I work as an assistant manager in the SF Bay Area. I didn't specifically seek out the industry that I am in - I started working minimum wage at my company and worked my way up over the past 3 years. I get paid a decent salary (60k with health/dental) and most of the time the work isn't too bad. Unfortunately a myriad of problems have come up somewhat recently that has me really considering finding a new job. 

Most of our core staff has left in the past 4 months and the newer staff is not experienced enough to handle the position without assistance yet. Further, a few staff members have proven to be very unreliable lately. We run a very lean staff (1 person per job during any given shift). What this means is that I end up having to be at work for the majority of our operating hours most days (10-14 hour work days, sometimes 7 days a week). 

On top of this, I have a boss that I have a good relationship with but he is a workaholic and prone to exploding when things do not go according to plan. I understand that as the assistant manager, my role is to act as a liaison between staff and the GM but I feel like I get chewed out when a member of the staff happens to call-out an hour before their shift or is running late. I hate conflict so these sorts of interactions bring me a ton of undue stress.

The combination of unreliable staff and a GM that blows up when things are not going well makes me feel that I can never ""turn off."" After work, I spend my evening constantly thinking/worrying about the next day. I spend days off worrying about how things are going in my absence. Even when things are going well, I don't particularly enjoy the work itself. This means that I often dread the next day of work. Lately it just feels like this feeling is magnified. 

&#x200B;

I have hit a point where I am ground down from the constantly long days where things are constantly going wrong and my boss is frequently upset with the status of things. I feel stressed/anxious/depressed most of the time and I feel like I have a severe gut reaction when thinking about work. 

&#x200B;

I bring all this up here to see if this is normal for most careers. I cannot tell if I am just weak-willed and need to push through or if this is out of the ordinary. I understand all the benefits of my job - I have reliable pay that pays rent and the commute isn't very far. That being said, I'm not sure if I can see myself advancing if it means having more responsibility within an industry that is already grinding me down after only a year of management.

If it is time for a career change, how does one go about it?

Am I wrong to be upset?,40,97jgsg,"Good Morning - 

So a bit of background - I work in a very small office - there are 4 1/2 employees. We are small but we are busy and everyone has more than enough work to fill their 40 hours - sometimes even more.  This year- we have had a hard time keeping someone in one of the desks. There has been four people in that role since November. When someone isn't on that role - I have been tasked with taking on all of their tasks, hiring the new person, and still doing all my work.  I think this year in total I have done this for like 6 months - but the last stretch was 7 1/2 weeks. 

During that time - I was working an average of 50-60 hours a week and still not getting everything done. Things were dropping through the cracks, some major items got put onto the back burner in order to get other things done, and basically it was a struggle just to stay afloat.  We got someone hired and they started Monday! I was so relieved. 

Also on Monday - my boss pulled me into his office with the rest of the senior staff to tell me about what an awful job I have been doing lately. At one point he said ""You were only work 10-15 extra hours a week - we expected a lot more from you. Things should not have been missed like this."" They put me on a performance improvement plan, have been riding my butt ever since, and are micromanaging like hell. Two months before this I got a glowing review that told me I was doing a great job, got a 22% raise, got more PTO, and was told they never want to lose me. 

I am so upset about being micromanaged, I am upset that they didn't give me any slack when basically doing all the work for both desks to make sure they had the things and support that they needed, I am most upset that they flat out have said (and confirmed in an e-mail) that I am to work as many over time hours as it takes to get work done - even if that is an extra 40 hours and I have to sleep here in the office. 

Am I right to be upset and considering a new job (even though I have only been here 18 months) or is it reasonable to think they are being unreasonable? I know I am a mid-management type roll and a exempt employee but is it normal to be expected to give up your entire life for them and to cut someone absolutely no slack when they are doing two jobs? 

I just need some advice so I can move on. My gut says that just because of the hurt and the lack of trust - it is time to move on. ",2018-08-15 19:02:30

Teacher having a quarter-life crisis... Is there hope for teachers? Is there a better option?,41,7fr07f,"My question is a little broader than the title implies... more of an existential crisis but I didn't know how to formulate that into a question.

I am a 26 year old, third-year teacher. This year I have hit kind of a quarter life crisis in my career. I love the school I am at (small, private school) but the pay is not great. I now make $35,000 a year, with a 1,000 increase yearly. Additionally, my SO and I are both very bored with the area we live in-- within the next year or so we are looking to make a move to NYC.

I am by no means a work-a-holic and really enjoy the time off I get in teaching. I also enjoy how happy it can make me, but also hate how down I can get over problem students. It is an emotional roller-coaster. I hate the pay. I also hate the amount of work it requires outside of the work day. It tends to give me anxiety on a Sunday night when my SO is just relaxing and I realize I have to lesson plan. 

My younger cousin on the other hand has just got a career offer straight out of college. It is with JP Morgan and the job is in Manhattan. I have not asked her base salary, but I am sure it is between 70k to 80k a year. I am feeling a bit ""less than"" if that makes sense...



I will not lie that I am feeling a bit of quarter life panic. I am not the kind of person that sees work as the sole purpose in life, but I also do not want too scrape pennies together for my whole life either. I want to enjoy my job, but also want to live comfortably.


I am considering leaving teaching (I know this is commonly asked here) but have no idea where to go from there. I have no interest in finances, banking, or any other stuff like that. I can have excellent work ethic when I am applying it to something I genuinely care for. Still, I'd rather not spend the majority of my time at work. I greatly believe in balancing work and life.

Here are some of my questions...

- *What is corporate America really like?*

- *What is a career path that is a happy medium between near-charity work and being a corporate ""worker bee""? How do I get there?*

- *Are there prospects for ""success"" for a teacher or do all teachers wind up burnt out and struggling financially?*

I need some encouragement and advice here. Thank you.",2017-11-27 02:10:26

"My job causes me so much stress, I need a change and want to take a sabbatical. Because my company doesn’t offer this, if need to resign and come back jobless, any advice?",41,acdrj1,"Here’s my backstory, I’m 36 and have been with my company for 10 years. I changed roles about 5 years ago, in that time I built up a client base from scratch, doubled my salary (which is mostly commission) and got a promotion.

Where I am now - I’m earning over 100k (I do live in an expensive city), I’m offered a great vacation package and my client base is incredibly lucrative (which wasn’t easy to get to), but my job is super high stress with tons of overtime (a good day is 10 hours but 12-16 hour days happen) I don’t find it fulfilling at all and I honestly get a knot in my stomach every time I’ve taken a vacation and think of going back, or even after a weekend. 

There’s no flexibility and because of all the overtime, it’s virtually impossible to find the time to go searching for a job. In addition to that, I’m not sure what I want to do that would be fulfilling, and this is the reason I wanted to take a 3 month sabbatical to travel. 

I’ve always dreamed of taking a long backpacking trip and being single with no kids and earning good money that’s just for myself, it feels like a great time. However, this is not offered by the company and won’t be approved, so I’d need to resign and come back to no job. I would have enough savings to cover my trip as well as a 3 month “cushion” of savings for when I return, should it take me a little longer to find a job. 

I feel like it’s something I really need right now, but am I crazy to quit and come back to living in an expensive city with no job? PS I even have friend who will take over my apartment for the time I’m away, the timing seems perfect. Any advice or thoughts will be appreciated! ",2019-01-04 05:09:51

How to Deal with Insecure Boss?,37,9xajlq,"I am in the simultaneously crummy and wonderful position of working in my older brother's company, so I can't just up and walk out of my job no matter how frustrating it is. For the same reason, my manager has been hostile toward me since day one. I feel like I am always fighting him to do my work, and he ties my hands as much as he possibly can so that I can't work around him. 

When I first signed on, my department was several months behind on work, and it was unclear how we were going to be able to catch up. I suggested several ways we could lean on electronic forms and automation to make the job easier and faster. For example, instead of entering data like we were point by point, we could get a cheap ($10/mo) helper program that would allow us to upload our work in bulk from Excel. We would only add one extra step in our processing and remove several others. Likewise, instead of writing out lots of detailed information by hand (in some cases, 10+ digit random numbers), I suggested that we could copy/paste into electronic forms to prevent coping errors and to get the info down faster.

In hindsight, I see that bringing these suggestions up so early was unwise even though the situation seemed dire. It set the tone for my relationship with my boss, who seems to fight me at every turn.  

My manager said he would look into it and bring it up in a meeting to the higher-ups, which includes my older brother. Without explanation,the ideas were dropped. I assumed that there was something about my plans that didn't gel with the business and moved on (more on that later).

Since then, I have had to fight tooth and nail to improve upon and expand my work. As my manager struggles to keep up with his workload, more and more of it has fallen to me, much to his chagrin. He is extremely territorial. He won't show me how to do things even though it will make his job easier. We stumble through a cycle of overload and crisis where I am fed additional duties of his job piecemeal as he struggles to keep his head above water. He has surpassed the breaking point on a lot of these duties but still refuses to delegate even a little bit to me.

In addition to being territorial,he has lied multiple times about my performance. Whenever his ""training"" (I use the term generously) left out an important detail or actually told me the wrong thing to do, my manager blames me for the resulting mistake and tells management it was my fault and that he gave me the right directions. Most of the time, he fails to notice any mistakes anyway because he clearly doesn't review my work, and I only find out much later that XYZ is wrong.

Recently, due to another crisis that has brought our department to its knees and after I became  suspicious of my boss's veracity, I asked upper management about one of the programs I mentioned before. Lo and behold, this was the first time the higher-ups had heard of it. Within five minutes of me presenting it, the program was adopted and we're using it now. It's probably cut our processing time down by at least 25% - all for $10/mo. That percentage will only grow as I learn how to use it 

I have talked about these issues with my brother and he has basically told me that I need to find a way to handle it. I admit that I'm not the most tactful person ever, so I know that I can improve how I interact with my manager. How can I do this now that this toxic dynamic has gone on so long? I have become extremely resentful of him, and my pride bristles at the notion of cooperating with him at all, as I'm sure he likewise feels about me. How do I get him to stop being so intimidated by me and to let me do my job? My brother suggested asking for his help on things even when I don't need it, but he usually doesn't want to bother or treats me like an idiot for asking.",2018-11-15 13:56:06
Feeling stuck and unskilled/How do I decide which path to pursue?,38,9vr8r6,"27F 

Typical situation I suppose: I'm feeling stuck and underwhelmed with life and am finding it very difficult to push myself in any direction. I'm pessimistic and shoot down any idea that comes to mind or that others suggest, I find faults and doubts in every possible plan, I have many interests and can't decide which one to pursue, and I don't necessarily believe in the idea of following my ""one true passion"" (I don't even have one). I'm desperate for some advice, and for a decent income. I'm trying to decide my next step in life and have never tried reaching out for advice from internet strangers before so here I am. I need someone to slap me in the face basically. Here's my background and problems:

I have a bachelor's in French and am fluent but I'm fairly certain I don't want to be a teacher. I've already taught English in France at the elementary level and I've taught French in California at the same level. Although I love kids, I just don't think teaching is my thing. I would like to do SOMETHING involving French though, but having a hard time making that into a tangible plan-perhaps working for a company in France that needs English speakers? Too vague. Being a translator? Need many more years of schooling/training. I could get a master's in French but that's largely geared towards future teachers and I would need to move which I am not prepared to do, and doubt I would need a master's if all I wanted to do was work in customer service or something. 

I'm also very drawn to the idea of marriage/family/sex counseling/therapy. I could get a master's in it at the school down the road from me. Of course I'm afraid it wouldn't be a good fit for whatever reason; what if I'm not good at it?

I fantasize about being a wedding/event/family photographer because I have always loved photography as a hobby and going professional could be quite lucrative, but of course there's all kinds of doubts that come with that. 

I've been a nanny/babysitter for over a decade, I've worked as a farmhand, I've had one single office assistant job, but my main job experience is working in restaurants as a server/barista/cashier/busser/hostess. I hate it and currently work as a busser and am dying to get out of this industry. The idea of temp agencies has recently been brought to my attention but it seems like it's only for people with clerical skills, of which I have none. However I'm interested in going in the office job direction just for a short while to gain some new skills while getting better pay than at the restaurant, but I don't have the skills I assume they need and the corporate/office world is completely foreign to me. I just seem to have this idea in my head that that's where the money is. 

I don't know how to pick one avenue. How do I stop doubting myself? How do I stop needing everything to be perfect before making a decision? How do I decide which path to choose? Thanks in advance for any and all advice. Sorry for the rambling. ",2018-11-10 05:45:05
Is conducting this job search at 42 years old a waste of time?,35,9ql00p,"I'm a 42 year old unemployed male. I graduated from a top 10 MBA in 2007. Post grad school, I worked on Wall Street as both a banker (6 years) and as a public equities investor at a hedge fund (5 years).  Over the summer, I was suddenly fired from my portfolio manager position. I had a good track record until February then hit a bad rut (six straight down months). I thought the chief investment officer would give me until year end to turn my performance around, but I was cut mid-year.  Unfortunately, investment management seems to be a ""one and done"" type career.

I've been running a job search for the past few months but I have received almost no traction. I've been trying all avenues ... networking, resumes, etc. etc. I've cast a wide net. I knew from the start that the search would be difficult, but this increasingly seems like a waste of time.

At 42, am I too old to find a new job? Am I over-experienced for almost everything? Should I just focus on buying a small business to grow? Any advice helps, especially from anyone who has successful found a job mid-life.

Word of advice to younger readers -- careful with risky career moves as you get older. If you look left and right and don't see anyone over 40 years old, beware.

"Coming out of tough situation, no job for 3 years. Trying to carve my own career path. Advice?",36,94e429,"So, long story short, I'm 26 years old. I graduated from college May of 2016, 3 days after graduation, my beloved father got stage IV colon cancer and died 9 months later, the cancer was brutal and the whole thing traumatized me and my mom. I obviously didn't work or look for a job while my father was sick as I wanted to try to save him, take care of him, and be with him. He died in February of 2017. It's been over a year. I still don't have a job. The first year was awful, I got severely depressed and immobilized. Not only that, I'm on welfare and so is my mom. We live together in a house that is a huge mess which used to be very clean and minimal before my dad got sick. Also, we can't afford to live in our house anymore, the property tax is high, we barely are making it by with food, bills, etc. 

If I try to find any job, I will lose my social security and end up working but probably earn about the same amount as my SSI monthly income. So, why get a job if I'm not fixing the money issue. Now, before you judge me. My college degree is 3D Digital Design for Video Games. I make video games and do game art. Getting a job in that field requires an excellent portfolio (resume does not matter that much in this industry). However, I must spend a lot of time (months) making something for my portfolio, I have been making a small indie game to sell online for a small price. So, it would be impossible for me to spend time on that if I get a job bagging groceries or something which will also take away my SSI and possibly make me and my mom go homeless.

I'm also very passionate about bodybuilding, fitness, and health. I have been thinking of getting a personal trainer certification as my second career or forget about game design all together. It may not make as much money as game development, but I think it would be less stressful. I can't take anymore stress as my health has almost failed due to insane amount of stress from the past 2 years. I know that personal training can be a crappy job if you work for a gym instead of freelancing or having your own gym. I'm not willing to give up my health or bodybuilding for the gaming industry which has 80 hours work weeks, I'm willing to try my best to make my indie game and sell online but there are good chances it might not pay off but who knows, I could get lucky and make a living. It has happened to other game designers. I'm also good with computers and fixing them, again that doesn't pay well. 

I have been hearing from others that I should try to create my own career path, carve my own destiny, make something that pays well but that I'm also passionate about.

Also, trying to get a job right now seems impossible. I'm dealing with so much financial issues at home, I got to sell the house, but my mom has so much stuff (a lot of it is also my dad’s). My house is like a hoarder nightmare. Now if it were me, I would just sell what's worth the money and throw everything away out on tree lawn, but my mom won't let me touch anything, clean up anything, box up anything for moving, or else she will get very angry. It's her husband/my father stuff and she want to deal with it herself, she has to be in control no matter what. She been having garage sales a few times but barely got anything sold. I try to convince her that most of the stuff is crap and nobody wants them. I'm getting closer to 27 years old, I don't want to be that weird guy who lives with his mom in the basement for the rest of his life. I hate my situation. It's like if it wasn't for my dad's cancer and the insane amount of medical bills from it, I wouldn't be in this situation, I would have been just looking for a job 2 years ago and go from there.

**What should I do? Keep going with my game design which I'm very passionate about and want to finish the project by end of the year and hope that I make money of it? If not, then personal training career?**",2018-08-04 01:31:50
"No qualifications due to mental illness, is there any hope in getting a job?",36,92h4lx,"When I was 16 I had a mental breakdown (BPD and psychosis) and was so unwell that I completely isolated myself from everyone and everything and stopped going to school.

How can I adjust my attitude toward my job?,37,8xvr35,"I have a job. It pays effectively higher than my current alternatives, and that's important to me. Trick is, I feel really down about the work, the place, and the people.

There have been a lot of trasitions at the top. My boss's boss left a year ago, and my boss just left. The people I have to interact with every day, I tend to like. The people I have to interact with on a weekly basis, I don't feel great about.

Its an educational organization, so there is a ton of variation in attitudes, beliefs, moods, and priorities. The work I do is not as interesting as I would like it. But my new boss is asking me to do interesting things, but I find myself without a cando attitude, instead I'm slightly bitter and its making it hard for me.

"How do I, an ex-surgeon, get into my next career?",35,8hfhot,"I recently resigned from a career in surgery. It was very easy in one way because the path up the career ladder was very obvious in progression. Bit now I am lost.

Reason was, basically I was depressed. I finally realised that the cost to my quality of life in a surgical career wasn't compensated by a true love of the job. This realisation  was hard to break through to because I always overcame the challenges before like the degree, the professional exams, the competitive application processes for the next career step. I left without a full plan for the next step because I had to save my health.

Since then I've seen a career counsellor, and a coach. Whilst they've been encouraging, it's been very much their intent to 'facilitate' and I feel a little lost. My family don't truly agree that I can do anything but medicine and mostly hope I return. But the thought of returning brings me put in a cold sweat.

I've read career books too, but I ultimately I feel like I don't know what to do next to work things out.

Where I have made contact with recruiters, I feel they don't understand how I have transferrable skills from my surgical career.

My interests would really be in the fields of Environmental Science, Women's rights, helping vulnerable people. But when I go on job websites I really feel I don't understand the roles. Should I resign myself to starting at the bottom in a new career? Should I go back to school and study?

More than anything I want to know the HOW.

TLDR; ex surgeon need to know how to get into a new career in environment/women's rights.

Should I Switch Jobs Again For a 40% Salary Increase?,39,8c031s,"Hey Guys,

Im hoping that the PF community could offer some advice on what to do with my current employment situation. Sorry for the wall of text.

After graduating university, I started working at a company that gave me a solid amount of work experience in the financial space. One year later I was offered a 40% salary increase to move to a different company, which I accepted. This new company is one of the best and most well known companies in the industry. I don’t typically work more than 40 hours per week, and my job isn’t very stressful. I have been performing well here and get along with my team. I am on track for a 20% raise in the next year along with a title upgrade.

Now, after a year of working for my current company I was approached by a small hedge fund. This company is offering a 40% salary increase along with some very large potential bonuses, slightly more vacation days, slightly higher retirement matching, and other small perks. This company is only a few years old and would require a lot more work, and would challenge me more. It seems that the workload would be closer to 55 hours per week and I would have less free time outside of work. There is also the risk of being let go if my performance isn’t what they expected.

I am conflicted because while I can see a successful future at my current company, the current offer from this hedge fund is very attractive (at least in the short term). Although on a resume, my current company would definitely stand out as a huge plus for any future employers looking to hire me once I have more experience.

The question here is, do I take the offer for more money in a position that has a higher risk? Or do I stay with my current company and grow into a more senior position before looking elsewhere?

For information:

I’m in my mid twenties, current salary is 82K USD, offer is for 115K USD. So far I’ve held both of my jobs for 1 year each.

Any input would be appreciated!

**TL;DR: Young guy in his mid twenties has already left his first job for a 40% salary increase. Should he do it again to work for a smaller company with more risk (but higher potential upside)?**",2018-04-13 18:36:03
Is it bad that I'd rather have an easy job than a job that pay well ?,38,812trg,"Hi !

Well, to put it simply, I'm 21 and ever since I started college, I've wasted a year in an english course to eventually be an english teacher (I live in France btw). Well, my grades were actually pretty good, but then I realized that maybe it wasn't for me. I was afraid of all the problems most teachers have to face everyday, and so now I'm studying to get ... a law degree. 
I've always wanted to try it, to see what it's like and maybe discover that I love it.

I'm currently in my first year, and I'm actually doing not so bad, so far my grades are alright. Not great, but not bad either. But it's only the first year, and while I don't care about studying for many years, I'm afraid of all the work they'll be expecting from me over the years, I dont know if I'm up to the task.
Besides, I started thinking about what I could do if I ever get the law degree I want and ... all these jobs seem to pay extremely well (or have the potential to pay well), but they look like the sort of jobs that gives you a lot of stress, and may even follow you at home.

The more I'm thinking about it, the more I feel like I don't care if I'm not paid extremely well as much as I care about having something easy (as in, not stress-inducing) to do. I also care about having some free time for me. I keep hearing about all these high-wage jobs where people don't have much time for their family, and I simply don't want that.

I feel like if I ever tell that to my parents, who always told me and my brother to work hard to get rich, they will think I'm stupid and don't know what I'm talking about. Would they be right ?

I just woke up, I'm terribly sorry about all the mistakes in this post, I hope it's still understandable. Thank you for taking the time to read this !",2018-03-01 07:06:37

I want to do something that I feel has value. I want to make something or help people in a concrete way. I help people now, but that's just because I fill in stupid forms the government makes them do. It's not real value, it's just helping deal with an artificial problem. 

I want to be on my feet. Even though my feet hurt all the time. I think my feet hurt all the time because I'm not on them enough.

I’m miserable and I haven’t got a clue. What’s wrong with me?,37,6sm7hs,"I have no idea where I’m going and what I’m doing in my career. How do I figure this out?

So, a little background, I’m 35 years old and decently educated. I have a BS in Aerospace Engineering, minor in mathematics, and an MBA (not from a top 20 school).

I continuously career hop, and I feel like I never perform well at any of the careers. I’ve gone through 3 engineering jobs, to a sales operations job, and now I’m a financial analyst at an asset management company. It seems like no matter what I do, I follow the same pattern. I start off doing well, but it seems like I never progress past what I’m doing when I first start the job, it’s like I remain entry level. Each job last 2 to 3 years, during this time my level of misery gradually increases while my performance gradually declines. This continues until I’m so miserable that I can barely pull myself out of bed in the morning. At this point, something normally happens that leads to another job (I’ve quit, been laid off, transferred to sister company, and been laid off again) then the cycle starts over again. Always 2 – 3 years, always ends in misery and with every cycle, the misery hits a lower low. This cycle needs to end because I can’t picture living the next 10 or even 5 years like this.

I used to think it was a wrong choice of career, or maybe just the wrong company, but by now it seems like a pattern surrounding me. Something must be wrong with me. Maybe I lack focus, maybe I’m lazy, maybe I’m just dumb, maybe it’s all those things.

I just don’t even know what to do anymore.

Are there good non-restaurant jobs (still in the food industry) for someone with restaurant management experience?,36,a71i4q,"Hey everyone,

First, a little about myself: I'm 35 years old, and have been working in the restaurant industry for the past 15 or so years, 5 of which are in management.  I'm completely burnt out by the industry at the moment.  Hate my job and going to work.  Don't have any benefits, and the pay is only ok (45k a year).  Never have nights or weekends or holidays off.  I'm at the point where I am ready to leave this industry altogether.  I have a little bit of college education (about 1 1/2 semesters away from an Associates Degree).  I LOVE many aspects of the food industry, but am almost entirely over actually working in a restaurant.  I'm also very ""techy"", dabbled in basic programming, regularly build my own computers, etc.  Have always been labeled a ""creative"" and a ""nerd"".  I'm so disgruntled with the industry though that I have even begun looking outside of it at stuff like HVAC, or finishing my degree and getting into IT.  But I'd hate to throw away the 15+ years of experience I've already accumulated.

So my main question is, are there people here who have had similar experience to me and switched to something else?  Anyone working in non-restaurant jobs that are still in the food industry that can offer me advice?  I've begun looking into avenues like sales jobs in food distributor companies (here in South Florida that would be something like Cheney Bros or US Foods) or possibly working for a spice supplier company like RL Schreiber.  The reason I started looking into HVAC was because, working in a restaurant, I get to see how often things like freezers and coolers need maintenance, and how lucrative it was for the guy we'd call out to fix them.  Another avenue I know i can look into is trying to become a hospitality manager at a hotel or hospital or something similar, but I fear that may be too similar to what I do now, and some of those may require a bachelors degree in hospitality.

I know I may have rambled a bit but I could truly use some advice as I am overwhelmed with my  current situation (I also just got married, and the wife is really pushing for me to find something ASAP since its not fun having an unhappy new husband).

Thanks in advance and I greatly appreciate any and all help and advice!",2018-12-17 18:52:39

Which one (or two) books/resources will teach me to think and communicate more like a management consultant?,33,9g0uqi,"I work for a B2B technology company in an account management position owning relationships to about 20 other companies who transact 8 digit figures on our marketplace. So I am somewhat of an experienced professional.

I do see that colleagues who come from management consulting have some amazing skills and I would love to get better at myself. 

In particular, they are all able to somehow abstracting a given situation (business opportunity, problems with partners, etc...) and intuitively understanding in which terms to think about the what and the how that actually matter to bring about a solution or to communicate in a very simple way internally what the situation is and what can be done. 

Unfortunately I don't work on any project with one of the colleagues from a management consulting background, and I do catch up with them about their ways of working every now and then, but I can't very easily copy all the good stuff, as we aren't working that closely. 

I moved countries and the culture I am originally from is very detail oriented, as in, one solves (and communicates) a problem by understanding \_all\_ the details and solving for them, and communicating in a similar manner. I now work in a culture, which is very much informed by American work culture and challenge solving approaches. So this adds to my own personal challenge in adapting some of that behaviour.

Should I try to salvage my career or move on?,36,9f8cex,"I have an English degree and worked as a proofreader and copyeditor at a publishing company for two years.

Is it possible to change careers at age 46?,37,8wh62j,"Sorry folks, long story. TL;DR is at the end.

I’m 46 years old, turning 47 in a few months. I live in the Midwest. I work at a job for a large corporation doing User Acceptance Testing. I’ve been there 15 years. I don’t really like the company I work for, and I don’t care about the job I have. The one good thing about this job is that I met my wife working for this company. She’s the love of my life. And lo and behold, I am blindsided by a 12 year old grand-daughter (I never use the word step) who I am completely crazy about. I’d do anything for her. She lives in California. Guess what, she wants us to move to California (Grandma used to live in California until about 9 years ago). I want to do it. I have no natural children of my own, and this little girl is as close as it is going to get for me. I may be a foolish “grandpa” but I think I’d regret not trying to move out there to be near her.

Anyway, I need a job out in California (Fresno to Anaheim, anywhere in those bounds) in order to move out there! I have a Bachelor’s degree in Theology, with which I’ve done squat. I’ve been taking course work in Info Technology at the local University’s satellite campus, but have been on hiatus for about a year, for one reason or another. The thing is, I’m really not that into I.T. And the thought of trying to get an entry level job in that world at my age is scary.

Since I have a B.A. I thought, why not try to build upon that and go forward with a Master’s in something? I instantly thought of Library Science! I love books and archives and libraries, and thought that would be a perfect match! My own mother is a librarian, for Pete’s sake! Complications arose with my application and acceptance at the one school I put all my hopes in, and now I’ve missed the deadline for all schools to be accepted into any reasonably priced program for this coming semester. I think for now I must shelve the idea of becoming a librarian, as I cannot spare a year unless I am doing something else to further my goal.

Other Master’s programs would be the obvious M.B.A. The problem is, I haven’t the least amount of interest in business. I realize that I may have to change my opinion of it in order to reach my goal, however.

I guess I am asking, is it feasible for me to change career paths at age 46 and move across the country to California? Any suggestions about what I should pursue? Maybe more college is not the answer. Thanks so much for reading this tome! God bless.",2018-07-06 07:28:16

How to tell my supervisor that I don’t have enough work because the guy I was hired to replace was hired back part time and is being given all the tasks instead of me?,33,8d8l93,"Sorry for the strange wording in the title! First time posting and on mobile so my apologies if I did something wrong and for formatting. TLDR is at the bottom. Thanks in advance for the advice!

I’m in an odd position in that I’m a little over a month into a new job and the individual that I was hired to replace, because he retired, has been brought back on for a temporary time. 

For some background: I work in the legal field in a support role capacity. This is absolutely the field I want to be in and I left my last position, also in the legal field, due to the poor pay, benefits, and toxic environment. I was incredibly happy to be offered my current position as it really closely aligns with my future career goals and the benefits are great. I’m working in the same area of law now as I did in my last job so I’m not a total rookie.

So the guy that retired but is back, I’ll refer to him as John for ease, has been back on the team for about 3.5 weeks now. John was brought because of a tight discovery deadline on a huge case. I was told that John would be here for a short time until I caught up and was familiar with the day to day and the huge case. 

I’ve been here 5 weeks and I have become comfortable enough with the day to day that I don’t need constant supervision. I’ve familiarized myself with the big case going on because no one will give me anything related to it. On top of this I do not have enough work to keep me busy through my shift because John is here. 

I’m frustrated because the attorney I’m supposed to be working with is not utilizing me and is instead giving things to John. 
 
And to be clear I have asked NUMEROUS times for tasks and to be given more responsibility but I am never given anything. I’m told they’ll find something and not to worry it’ll pick up. But frankly as long as John is still around I don’t see that happening.

So I want to speak with my supervisor (who also supervised my attorney) about this but don’t know how to go about doing it since I’m basically asking her to let the guy go as I don’t need the additional help. Any advice on how to broach this topic in a professional manner would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: I have been with my organization a little over a month. The individual I was hired to replace had retired but has been brought back to help with a big litigation case and is being given all the tasks instead of me despite me asking for more work daily. How do I  talk to my supervisor professionally about this dynamic and let her know I don’t have enough work. I’m aware that I’d be asking for them to let the retired guy go since I’d be saying I don’t need the additional support.",2018-04-18 22:51:29

Moving cross country with lots of experience; why no callbacks?,36,aq6rqe,"I have well over a decade in a growing technical field, particularly within the context of a heavily-regulated industry, so I also have experience in that framework. I have great references, and have a great relationship with former bosses. Clean background check. Currently employed.

I'm hoping to move across the country, from a mostly rural area to a major city. I noticed a lot of jobs there are looking for a particular professional certification. 

I'm not getting callbacks, even on jobs that require half my experience. This isn't what I expected, since my field is lucky enough to have very low unemployment. I have been tailoring my cover letter for the best prospects, researching the company, and laying out why their stated mission aligns with my values and skill set.

Here's the worries I have:
* I went out and passed the professional certification test in December. Full certification comes after the body verifies the required experience. They haven't finished that yet; they say they haven't started. I have proof that I've completed testing requirements, and proof that I have the requisite experience. The schedule is such that I'd be certified before my first day. 
* I have a GED and no college. Most jobs say nothing about college requirements, or, ""bachelor's or equivalent experience."" I figure doing the exact job I'm seeking for 13 years is equivalent experience. Am I wrong?
* I don't have a local address on my resume. We haven't rented a place there yet. 

My spouse is supposed to start work next month; I'm running out of time. I have a flight booked to sign on a new place next week, and I don't have an interview scheduled. 

I can't speed up the final certification, I can't move the moving date as there are other commitments at play, and I definitely can't get a 4 year degree in the next month.

"Should i feel guilty potentially abandoning the project i was hired for, because of being slightly unhappy?",37,amf77l,"So I currently have an internship at almost a dream firm for people in my city and career path. I'm still in college (junior year) and took this *paid* internship at this firm in July. It's an amazing place to work in terms of resume, but my tasks are very meaningless, not really any room for improvement. One other main thing, my internship was only supposed to be for the summer, but it got extended because I am working on a very specific project with one other intern.

I have worked there for about 6 months, and my unhappiness really kind of came to realization a few weeks ago. It was my birthday and not one single person bothered to acknowledge it(rather significant one too, my 21st), more or less I don't think most people knew about it. I know it seems like a very petty reason to be annoyed at my job, but A) it was in that moment I realized I have been doing the same mind numbing task of archiving files for 6 months B) there was very unlikelihood of me really doing anything other than this boring task, at least until after this summer C) the pay is rather moderate, with most fast food chains paying at about the same rate in my area or just very slightly below,  D) I spend about 8 hours a day literally not communicating with anyone (I pretty much just scan and drag and drop files all day, and am told to just wear headphones so I don't go insane as I hermit away in solo cubicle) and E) the task I've been given isn't really in the field I wish to be involved in in the future, but the firm itself is in that field.

I don't know, I just feel like I've kind of become subhuman in the eyes of my co-workers. My pay has shown no signs of really ever changing, to put in perspective my girlfriend who works in the same field as my saw 3 pay raises and about 1k in bonuses in the same time period I have been working at my place (granted hers is an actual position and I'm still an intern). I saw a mere $50 bonus about a month ago. Wasn't eligible for Christmas bonus (or at least didn't receive it), didn't receive a change of pay when evaluations were going on, just am literally not acknowledged at all.

So my main questions are: am I being too petty about not really being acknowledged since I'm just an intern? Since this is an internship at a very good firm, do I just suck it up and accept that I don't get paid well, but am paid better via my resume? And is it shitty to just kind of leave about halfway through my project that I was hired for? My girlfriend encouraged me to send a few resumes out to other firms in the area because I've been very unhappy the last month or so, and know that I could find better pay elsehwhere if I really tried. (after her boss said he would pretty much hire me on the spot for my work history, but since we live together we decided working together would be too much as well). I'm not necessarily strapped for cash. I am pretty good at managing my expenses and with tax returns inbound for a decent amount and a refund from my University (too much from scholarships) in bound, I could potentially live comfortably the next 4 months not working (not choosing to do that, mainly want more experience and better networking experiences).

What can I do as a college graduate with 2 degrees in English Literature?,35,aiafsg,"Recently obtained my post-graduate (honours) degree in English Literature. Turned down an opportunity to continue in academia because I enrolled at the age of 25 and am almost 30. 

My degree makes me eligible to teach, but I have no interest in teaching. I have 4 years of work experience in the service industry (generally working in kitchens etc.).

I have few aspirations regarding career choices and am open to any suggestions. I dread working desk jobs however, because I worked part-time for my university's registrar and it bored me to tears. 

I understand this is incredibly general. I have begun the job hunt, but having only ever worked un-skilled jobs (or have otherwise been trained from scrap), I'm not sure where I should be looking.

I can't decide whether to look for another job or not. What would be your advice?,36,a31uuw,"Many aspects of my job are good: company car, well paid, I attend quite a lot of work-related events, and it suits my skillset (writing).

&#x200B;

One thing that I really don't like, and is making me consider moving, is there is no social aspect to it at all. The office is constantly so quiet that you can hear a pin drop, I'm one of the youngest by 10+ years, and I often spend my lunch alone. I don't want to go in to work just to socialise, but not having that aspect at all really bothers me. Another point, I have to produce a lot of content for the business, but it's content I'm not interested in at all (construction/facilities management), which doesn't help the 'lonely' part. 

&#x200B;

My question: do you think that's a justifiable reason to leave? If I left, it would be a lateral move, but my worry is that the company I move to doesn't look after their employees as much as mine does and 'better the devil you know' and all that. Advice needed! ",2018-12-04 17:52:03
"My manager makes me hate my job, any way to help with that?",38,9j607p,"So a little over two months ago, I started as a bank teller at some bank. And let me just start out by saying I have a very bubbly personality and I’m a very tiny girl who works with larger people. At first, everything was okay except my BOM (my higher up below manager) started telling me all of these rules. I couldn’t go to the bathroom more than twice a day, I couldn’t have my chest showing/low cut shirts, even though I had no boobs/cleavage showing and other girls did. I couldn’t hum or sing, I couldn’t tap my fingers, flick my pen, any of my anxiety relievers I couldn’t do because my BOM said “you know I’m not being mean, I’m just telling you before the manger does and she won’t be as nice as I am”. And this was all the first week, and I thought okay maybe they’re just being over dramatic because I’m new and boy, I was wrong. My manager now yells, belittles, and demeans me on a daily basis. She will repeat everything I do wrong twice to me to make me understand how incompetent I am and remind me that I’m an idiot. I will take notes on policies and procedures to do and anything I’ve messed up on in the past, to help not make the same mistakes, and then when I do it “right” she’ll come over and explain to me what else I did wrong even though I did everything she told me to. She constantly makes me feel irrelevant and stupid, I hear her talking shit on ME with my BOM and other coworkers, and she even sent me an email today at 7:58am, when she’s even out of the office today, to tell me how when I left last week that I messed things up and “better not happen again”. 

Also this happened to another teller. She worked here for two years and apparently was treated even worse every day and got transferred to another branch because she put in so many complaints to HR. And my current manager still talks shit on her.

You know, I’m only 20 but this is my 14th job since I was 13 and this is literally the worse job I’ve ever had. I never knew that I could feel like a piece of shit everyday for doing my job. So I guess my question to you all is, is this fucking normal? Is this just a part of life, hating a job you have to go to because of the pay and benefits? Is it really worth staying?

Today has just been my breaking point with all of this because I’ve been severely depressed since I’ve started this job. So please, advice?",2018-09-26 23:03:54
How do I leave my company when they rely on my for everything?,36,9apw5k,"EDIT: Repost since I forgot it needed to be a question. 😅

It makes me worry less how the company will do after my departure. It's takes the weight off my shoulders and I'll look to let my boss know sooner than later!

I'm a developer in San Francisco stuck in a situation where I have been a solo developer in a company for almost year now. That usually means long work hours alone and on weekends. To be honest, I expect this on some level in my field and area. What really bothers me is that my company doesn't really seem to value technology in the way most San Francisco companies do. They view it as an operating cost and don't bother to see what can be done with it, rather they see it as what we need it to stay afloat. They neither operate in such a way that makes it fun nor meaningful to work there. I want to leave, but the company has relied on my labor to stay afloat. Leaving would be a huge hit to their ""roadmap"" and I have no idea how to let my boss know I'm leaving. I just want some advice, before I go and tell him my intentions.",2018-08-27 18:28:04
Can i change careers at 40yo successfully?,34,91ken1,"I have been in my current career for about 20 years.

Also working in a field where your pay is performance based can make it tough to keep a steady income and plan a future.

How do you deal with feeling disrespected by your boss?,37,8z97jt,"I feel so angry with how I’m being treated in my job. The company is run somewhat chaotically so I’m trying to look at how I’m being treated rationally and not as a personal attack. However, after being told in April that I was being moved up a level (to “senior”) I had a goals and development plan (4 months late) meeting with my boss the other day, who acted surprised when I brought up the title change. She said “oh that’s not happening now”. I was really shocked. I’ve only ever received positive feedback and my work is always well received. I’ve also taken on extra responsibilities in order to progress in the company. I was told that more goals need to be met and my title change will be reviewed in September. I feel very disrespected and don’t feel anything said to me is the truth or genuine. I understand that they owe me nothing but to be lied to surely has some HR consequences? I would like to speak with HR on this however I know my boss would be really annoyed by me “bypassing” her like this and then treat me even more poorly. Any advice appreciated, thank you.

I’m trapped in the family business. How can I make the best of this situation?,34,8xhf99,"Don’t know where to post this, but I feel absolutely trapped in a family business with no opportunity for growth.

A little backstory, 2 and a half years ago my dad wanted to start a tech company and wanted me to work with him. I agreed because I love working with my dad. He funds the project and I basically do all of the work, however I have little creative control. Everything I do needs to go through him.

While doing this, my dad decided to start a bunch of other businesses. He opened a franchise, a second store, a club, and a couple other projects. The problem is that he doesn’t focus nearly as much as one should on any of them and they all do just okay.

I keep asking to get creative control and he says no it’s fine. I have also been conscripted to work all of these other businesses on the admin side. I build and manage all of the websites, payroll, design work, you name it. My responsibilities have only piled up.

Worse, I haven’t gotten any sort of raise since I’ve started. With all of the new responsibilities I haven’t seen an extra dime. I’ve asked for a raise and he just gets upset, saying he’s running out of money.

I’m working on this tech company right now in a hot retail storefront, putting in a 10 hour day.

What do I do? I love my dad and I don’t want to damage our relationship. But I don’t have any career advancement besides that I own 10% of this tech company. But I’m trapped with other work that’s unrelated, I’m not networking. I was going to school but dropped the next few semesters due to being busy so I don’t have a degree to fall back on.

I don’t want to damage my relationship with my family. I really don’t. But I need a raise to cover rising prices (I live in LA), and I just need to advance as a person. 

I’ve learned so many skills doing everything, I can manage a payroll, I can use the adobe suite, and I can manage employees. But I’m trapped. Is there a way to break this news to my family without them hating me? Is there any advise you can give?",2018-07-10 02:04:16
Is it possible to completely change career at 50 yrs ? Somebody did it ?,32,7zguu8,"50 yrs old male here, in Europe.

Not a social guy, quite lonely: I enjoy staying with family and some (few) friends, and I’m not interested to know new people or socialize.

Due to life circumstances I’ve ended up in software sales. I’ve been enjoying a quite successful sales career in major software companies so far. I’ve been in the company where I’m currently employed since about 11 years, the longest I’ve been in the same company so far.

The last 2 years were not so successful.

It started by getting that “Groundhog Day” feeling: even if I was meeting new customers/prospects or trying to sell new solutions, everything started to feel the same as it was. You know, when every situation seems to repeat itself over and over. I already knew the kind of issue/problems/objection a customer would put me in, and I started losing enthusiasm in countering it. Suddenly I was thinking “as I know what will happen, I don’t even want to make it happen”.

Then the same started happening for my “internal” activities. You know, the usual endless negotiations you have to have with internal functions (ie admin, finance, legal, management) when you’re trying to build up a proposal/solution. I knew in advance the objection I would get, and the meetings I would be in, and the things I would have to do to find the usual compromise that would make everybody happy. And suddenly it was better not to get new opportunities, because then it would be about getting once again into internal discussions.

I find that suddenly I don’t want to discuss or talk or manage and interact with other people, being those customers or colleagues. I’m not sure if this happens because I’m losing enthusiasm, and I’m bored and tired and this makes me antisocial, or if it’s simply my antisocial part growing and claiming the attention it deserves after all those years being neglected.

So here I am, 50 yrs old, suddenly not sure about my future.

I started looking to other opportunities in my area (sales), but after looking at those I’ve realized it would be more of the same.

But what can a 50 yrs old antisocial guy do, out of what he did for his entire working life ?

Shall I take a chance and look for something completely different ? Something out of my area ? Or shall I try to stick in sales and simply push forward because I'm just a spoiled grown up kid ?

As you can probably see, I'm not really sure about what to do, so anybody else that has been in a similar situation caring to comment and/or provide suggestions would be welcome.

EDIT 1: thanks for all the suggestions. I think I should really decide something. This would be a first step. So far the only thing I did was complaining on my own, which is not really a constructive way out of this situation. I keep complaining about the repetitiveness of my job and my customers and my colleagues and I want to be alone etc etc etc but I do nothing besides telling myslef ""what can I do ? I have a family, a wife, 2 kids..."" and maybe using this as an excuse to do nothing and remain stuck where I am, as I am. Hmmm. Not sure what to decide, but I need to decide something. At least it would be a step forward.",2018-02-22 19:59:16
Can you have a career without being a manager?,37,7wcvd3,"It appears to me that no matter the industry, the career path almost always includes becoming a manager and moving away from technical work. The higher paying positions are all managerial and often the only way to move upwards is to drop what you're good at and start leading and organising people instead.

Is there a way around this? Can I find a good career path where being good at the technical parts of the job is rewarded, financially and through acknowledgement? Are jobs in tech companies different in this? Are there freelance consultant specialists that manage to make it by just being great at what they do?

"I'm almost 35 and I'm a ""job drifter"" and I'm still lost. I want to figure out what it is I should be doing with my life. Maybe this can help?",35,5veqcn,"Hi everyone. Fair warning, I'm not too good at ""short stories"" but I'll do my best to keep everything concise.

I'm about to be 35 in a few weeks and I've been working random jobs since I was 16. I can't remember all of them but if you count having a job as collecting a paycheck (even one) from any place of employment then I have had close to or over 30 different jobs in that time span. I've worked on a farm, in grape vineyards, a bowling alley, Ponderosa, Walmart, Old Navy, Target, Home Depot, Dollar Tree, customer service call center, debt collections, a juice factory, a grocery store, a mini golf course, a gas station, a newspaper, sorted cans and bottles at a recycling center, sold expensive cutlery, worked in a group home assisting developmentally disabled individuals, worked in a pre-vocational center assisting developmentally disabled individuals, delivered in-home medical equipment for Hospice, worked in a short-term rehab for young adults struggling with substance addiction... I may be forgetting some but that's the gist. Since 2008 I've worked in human services and it's a decent fallback because the money is alright for a high school grad but it can be very stressful work and it is not something I want to do for a long time.

I tried college at different times in my life. Both community colleges and both tries lasted about two semesters. I was enrolled in an art institute when I was 19 but I'm from a very small town and was thrust into a big city when I was completely not ready and came home before even attending a class.

Growing up I dreamed of being a pro football player (American) but the NFL doesn't have many places for pudgy asthmatics last I checked. Throughout high school I enjoyed art classes and acted in every high school play from grades 7-12. I was also a pretty good bowler. Yes, bowling. Hey, don't laugh, my tiny high school team (graduating class of 51) won three straight division titles against schools with graduating classes numbering in the 1000s. 

Towards the end of high school I began to tinker with simple graphic and website design. Have a cousin who was always very involved in that and I'd spend free periods messing with early versions of Photoshop, Microsoft FrontPage (bet no one remembers that) and teaching myself some HTML. I wanted to go to school for website design stuff but that type of career was still fairly new as the web hadn't quite yet taken off. Websites were still mainly text-based and not at all what they are today. Therefore there weren't any schools near me offering those types of courses. It was all computer science or programming and I wasn't interested in that. One community college course I took was an ""Intro to the Web"" class in which the final project was to create a three page website. I skipped the entire class and handed in my final project (a five page site with way more than required) because I had been designing and updating my high school's website since I was a junior.

I do struggle with some mental stuff. Who doesn't these days? I grew up with OCD, anxiety/panic disorder and depression. I manage, as we all do. But work has always given me a great deal of trouble and I tend to think it's one of the reasons I have such a hard time holding down a job for any period of time longer than 3 years (that's my record, three whole years in one place) and I feel it interferes with my motivation and ambition... sometimes it feels like I have neither.

I know we all have to work. I just want to be able to come home and tell my wife, ""Hey look at what I did today"" and not ""If I have to go back to that place one more day I'm gonna drive my car into a tree."" It's always been very frustrating. I've had mental breakdowns in which I've missed substantial time from work because I couldn't deal with the stress and what I was feeling.

My most difficult hurdle is figuring out just what I should be doing. I feel like I'm a creative person. My mother is an artist and my father is a carpenter (although he's worked in a factory for 37 years to provide while doing carpentry stuff on the side) and they've been doing their own craft business for about 17 years now. They go to festivals and shows all over the area and recently my wife and I have been discussing getting their things on Etsy. I've also felt like perhaps I could start making some things to sell along with them and see where it goes. The trouble is, is it's an unknown entity and it's hard to just jump into something like that when you need a steady job to provide while you try to figure out how to make it work. And whenever I take on another random job I just shut down. Whatever the schedule is, on whatever days I have to work, I'm useless. I'm miserable, I don't speak to anyone, I go off on terrible rants about how bad I hate it and I basically have to talk myself out of an anxiety attack every time I get in the car to go to work. I don't wanna have to go through this anymore.

A few years ago I took some SEO/blogging courses because I've always been decent at writing but I burned out on that too. A few years before that I came real close to going to a design school but a job came up that I had no choice but to take and the school didn't offer night classes so it was just back to work.

I'm caught somewhere between wanting a type of career where I can be creative and something that I can run from home. Lately I've been thinking about the design school again because I've always enjoyed typography and making logos and I thought maybe I could be someone who makes invitations and cards or even posters or whatever and sell that on Etsy. The tough part is making the decision to go into debt to pay for college. Luckily my wife and I have made a pretty good life for ourselves despite my shortcomings, we always make rent, we don't starve, we drive decent cars and live in a good area and neither of us have massive amounts of college debt hanging over us.

I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I'm tired of going around and around with this stuff all the time. I know not every job is cupcakes and rainbows and I get that, I just want something that doesn't fill me with complete dread every single day. I feel good about creating. I feel maybe a tiny bit of entrepreneurial sense within me... I just flip flop on a direction and my work ethic is crap. And I dunno why. Everyone I'm surrounded by has a good work ethic. I just feel so defeated and deflated by every job I've ever had to do. (If you're wondering how I keep getting so many jobs, I'm a really good interview. I've done it enough times to know exactly what they wanna hear.)  I've never felt good about any of the work I've done. It's always just been a paycheck. I don't wanna have to feel like that anymore. Is there a direction I can be pointed to? My mind changes on me more than the weather so one day it may be ""Design!"" and the next it'll be, ""Are you serious you frickin' loser? You can't do that, you suck."" I've always been this dreamer who's always felt anything and everything is so unattainable. How do I fix that? 

I apologize for the novel and I thank anyone that read through it and anyone that may offer some advice. Thanks. ",2017-02-22 00:36:01
"Unable to move up at current job and not getting offers for other jobs, what do I do?",36,bumkg5,"I've been at my current position for 5 years, and despite what I believe have been contributions to the team and organization above and beyond what others in my department have done, I've been told the only way to move up is outside of the finance department. I've also looked for other jobs internally, but no luck. I've not had a title change in those 5 years and I'm feeling like other potential employers look negatively at that, despite the ambition I've shown.

&#x200B;

I have great professional relationships with several executive members with whom I've shared my concerns, but at the end of the day they've just been an ear to lend. I will say that the first two years at my job, I was cranking out stellar work and putting forth effort. But being told there is no way to create a new title for me has really weighed down on me and I've since been putting in about 8 hours of actual work a week (for a 40 hr/wk job). I know I'm responsible for creating my own situation, but I feel it's fruitless at my current job. And externally, I've been a runner up for several jobs I've interviewed for over the last 3 years but no offers.

Notified recently I'll be getting laid off. What can I do as a software engineer with limited experience?,34,bnd50c,"As the title says, I was notified recently I'd be getting laid off in the upcoming months. To say I'm devastated is an understatement. Good ole outsourcing strikes again. 

I'm a software engineer who has been with this company since I graduated 5 years ago. However, programming wasnt my major in college so my knowledge and skillset is limited. The work I did there was pretty niche(developing legal documentation with system data) and not common among other employers. 

Every job opening ive looked at has positions for stuff I have very limited experience with. I earned a level II position but that didnt really come with any different responsibilities. 

So essentially, I'm in panic mode. My resume has been roasted by recruiters and any phone interviews I got, I wasnt what they were looking for. I'd love to learn everything about programming but I don't have the resources to actually learn the material. Online tutorials can only do so much. 

I have basic experience with SQL, VB.net, C# etc... I cant even effectively describe my current job responsibilities on my resume without it sounding like I'm not qualified for anything. Whatever job I get, I'd have to be trained. Theres no way I could get a brief overview and just dive into the work and be effective. 

I have about half my salary worth of savings but I'm terrified I'm gonna lose everything. My house, car, and I got a big dog to take care of as well. This is wreaking havoc on my physical and mental health. I've been out of college for too long to actually pursue careers in my degree's field.

How do I break the chains?,36,baum24,"EE here with golden handcuffs, 33/M w/family, I average 5-10 hours of work a week at my FT. I'm literally not sure why they hired anyone for this role..

&#x200B;

I know no matter what I say, I'm going to get the response, ""Shut up, I'd kill for that."" so fuck it. I make $170k TC, \~$30k in bonus, RSU, stock purchase, retirement, and HSA grants. If you believe payScale that's >90th percentile.

&#x200B;

I previously worked for a startup making $145k Cash TC. The end was near so I punted. I was hesitant to move to the larger company, but the actual team size in this division is smaller than the team at my startup, and I was told they were a ""Startup in a big company."" The old job had me put in 40+ hours a week. It was engaging, I felt that I had control of our collective destiny, it wasn't perfect, it was down right fucked, but at least I felt like what I did mattered.

&#x200B;

New job? It's painful. Maybe for some people the praise and appreciation for menial tasks is fulfilling? I feel the exact opposite, if I'm not challenged by the problem I really don't care if you appreciate what I'm doing, I'm bored, and the menial task is killing my insides.

&#x200B;

My golden handcuffs are two fold. 

&#x200B;

1 - My base pay at startup and even now (albeit lower) is in the top for my field regardless of YOE. I've had recruiters hear my TC and say things like, ""Wow, you know that's director level pay right?""

2 - Then, my extras put me way beyond.

&#x200B;

So, I've had roles come in $10k less than my base, I ask ""Is this TC or is there still a bonus program/anything else?"" it's TC with formal bonus. The good news is recruiters seem to be open to having these types of discussions early on, but the bad news is I'm so far out, they don't even present me. $40-50k is a lot to make up in negotiations.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do to get out of this hell hole.

&#x200B;

So far:

&#x200B;

1. I've taken a risk to begin side work. Started in February and have already billed 40+ hours with some good relationships formed that are leading to another 40+ hours. Workload so far averages to 5 hours/week (read: equal to my FT) which is enough to give me something to do at night, but not enough to start a FT business.
2. Applied/Accepted to CS masters program online. Company reimburses tuition costs in an amount that covers this degree. Comes with 2 year claw back, I plan to set the money aside to cover the cost of the program and also take the cash from the company. If the claw back kicks in, so be it, but I'm not leaving money on the table. Workload \~20 hours/week.

I write code for work here and there. I can read, understand, edit, find bugs, get my own things working at the low level. I don't necessarily work at the high level, and if some prick wants to challenge me on foundations of CS, I definitely won't know the best algorithm, have the lightest code, or even use the write words to describe something I did. But I did it, it works. That being said, the masters program is an attempt to formalize my education and enhance my skill set further. This will only lead to me being further over qualified for this shit job, but it's hoping I can jump into something more challenging?

&#x200B;

I've had the conversations with my manager, ""There doesn't appear to be any EE work, this worries me."" Trying to tread lightly, I don't want to talk myself out of a job, but all the while expressing that the work doesn't interest me or utilize my skill set. 

&#x200B;

My current claw back/pay out schedule -

&#x200B;

June - $10k signing claw back ends

July 4 - $3.5k Stock award vests

Nov 15 - $5.2k Stock award vests

Dec - $16k Bonus

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm trying to put my job search on the back burner so I don't give back $10k, but I've got 30-35 hours/week sitting at a computer doing random shit and I can't keep my eyes off job boards. I don't have any active interviews at the moment, but if I were to go through the process, hoping I could tell new employer 6/1 start date, each day that goes on seems like that isn't too far fetched (51 days to go!)

&#x200B;

TLDR:

&#x200B;

$170k TC is top 10% pay for field performing 5-10 hours of actual work a week. Not fulfilled. How do I transition to a new job without taking a major pay cut? Can anyone relate?

&#x200B;

Oh and.. yes I know, I'm a whiny little bitch that makes a shit ton to do jack shit. Thanks.

"Found my passion late, what do I do?",31,an77au,"Hi, i'm a 22 year old graduate student.  I am scheduled to graduate in December with my masters in Computer Engineering.  I chose this path because I was naturally good at math, and I kinda liked computers; plus I know it will pay me well.  Unfortunately, during the last few months I've found that my passion is mental health.  I have my own struggles that I have worked through and I'm continuing to work through them; but I absolutely love talking about them and helping other people.  Mental health is something that every single person struggles with at some point, and no one wants to talk about.  I want to change that and help as many people as I can feel like they aren't alone.

&#x200B;

Basically, my question is, what would you do if you were in my situation?   I'm on an amazing track to graduate basically 2 years earlier than most engineering Master's students, and I also have 0 college debt because I got a full ride.  But, I know working this job the rest of my life wont make me feel fulfilled.  I don't want to throw the last 5 years of school away and go back to the beginning and get a psychology degree... Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.  I can answer any more questions if you have any as well.  Thank you so much.",2019-02-05 00:25:57
Ways to start a career in copy writing?,34,am3we7,I've been looking to switch careers into something that gives me more freedom and also utilizes my love for writing and advertising and after some research I have stumbled across copy writing. I have read a couple articles on how to get started in the field but I would like to get some advice from people in the field and get some tips on what to do and what not to do while starting up a new career. I am also curious about how big my portfolio should be and what are the key points I can showcase to really wow potential clients? Thanks for the help!,2019-02-01 18:39:17
What are some good career-paths for non-competitive people?,35,a4ytr0," 

First, some background to my situation and personality. I'm currently in the recruiting/sales industry and before that I worked in customer service/sales. Those experiences alerted me to several ""push factors"" that I DO NOT want to deal with in my next position:

1) I don't want to be in a customer/client-facing role -- Having spent the past 4 years trying to satisfy my customers and clients (and dealing with the unreasonable expectations thereof) I really want a career that does not center around dealing with people and their desires/whims.

2) I don't want to 'put out fires' -- In my current role, I do temp-recruiting; unfortunately a large part of my day is spent dealing with issues that come up outside of my control (e.g. my temp did not show for the day and I need to get someone out to the worksite by lunch to cover; the client misunderstood/misrepresented the workload and they actually need 3 temps rather than 1, etc.) and then scrambling to put out the 'fires' caused by other people. To be clear on this point, sometimes I make mistakes too; I have no issue admitting and scrambling to fix issues caused by my own mistakes, I'm just tired of having to deal with solving problems of others' making.

3) I don't have a competitive personality -- Finally, I just don't have a very competitive personality (which is clearly not a trait that helps you excel in a sales job). I don't necessarily hunger for the next promotion, more responsibilities, or to prove myself to peers. While I'm not scared of more responsibilities, I'm comfortable being more of a 'worker bee.'

One career in consideration is an airline pilot: it seems like I would avoid most of the ""push factors"" listed above. You're not dealing with customers; in fact, there's a locked door between you and them. You're not putting out 'fires'; sure, mechanical/weather/delay issues come up but it's not your job to fix those: you just have to get the plane safely from A to B (hopefully you never encounter anything devastating in the air). Finally, you don't need to be competitive to be successful; assuming you meet certain minimums, promotions come based on seniority rather than performance.

""Pilot"" is not entirely out of the question but my wife and I are concerned about me being away from home so often and the strain that could put on our future family. So, I hope to get some suggestions of other career paths that will let me avoid those ""push factors.""

Besides a background in sales, recruitment, and customer service (areas that I *think* I want to get away from), I have an English degree, I enjoy non-competitive outdoor sports (scuba diving, surfing, hiking, camping, off-roading, etc.), I'm definitely a nerd (I enjoy video games, trading card games, tabletop games, etc.), and my wife and I love travelling. Once we decide to have kids, I will most likely be the sole breadwinner for our household; so while salary/pay rate is not the most important factor in a career choice, it definitely has to be taken into consideration.",2018-12-10 21:25:05
"Flipping between wanting a certain career path, then not wanting it, and then back. Advice?",31,a0dp0b,"So here's the deal: My B.S. is 8n Math and I have an education in Molecular Biology, Mathematics and Computer Science. I've been thinking that I should combine them - and maybe study a little Chemistry and Physics - to become someone who creates molecular models of chemical reactions and/or models of large scale dynamic cellular systems.

I could totally become a data scientist later on with that background. I used to love these subjects a few years ago but have had a lot of personal stuff happen since then.

There are times I see something while learning from a C.S. course that makes me go 'Cool!' Additionally, there are times I review my comprehensive Molecular Genetics textbooks - or read peer reviewed paper abstracts - and feel this is exactly what I want to do.

Yet, more often, there are times where I lose interest in reviewing my textbooks, reading academic papers, or doing Computer Science assignments entirely. I will literally stop doing those things things for days. I'll then tell myself that I'll read again, but still choose not to read for another 3-4 days. I lose faith in my plans of further education while I'm like this too. I'm not quite sure how often I lose interest, but it feels like I spend less time being productive on these things than not doing those activities. I still go to the gym regularly (3 days a week) and walk a couple miles each day.

I should add that I'm going on 25 soon and don't socialize much. All this makes me feel lost at times... not knowing what I want to do with my career or what advanced education I should pursue (though I think that getting a Master's focused on Machine Learning is really important).

Job Advice For Leaving Mormonism?,37,93jv9f,"I was raised as an LDS Mormon. I was all in for this religion. I spent every Sunday with at least 3 hours at church. I spent 2 years working as a missionary.

As a missionary you only get weekly email contact with your family, no movies, no internet, no news, no contacting friends, obviously no romantic relationships, and you must always remain with your companion at all times. Breaking any of these rules could result in being sent home early from your mission, which would go on your record and result in a lot of public shaming. Mormon women often say they'll only marry returned missionaries, and that sort of sentiment is encouraged.

I loved the church, I loved being a missionary, but if you're thinking Handmaid's Tale, you're only a few degrees removed.

I was homeschooled and then went to a community college when I was 16. I could have gone to some top schools, but I chose the LDS owned church Provo's Brigham Young University (BYU).

I eventually became disillusioned with the church. I found out about the church's racist history, current toxic homophobia, and misogynistic trends. For example, BYU literally tortured gay kids with electric shocks as they showed them gay porn for months. The guy in charge of BYU who signed off on the project is currently the second most powerful member of the church. Church leaders have retconned most of history so most members think that the church has been progressive. Most think the church supported Martin Luther King instead of calling the civil rights movement a communist plot and blacks inferior in the eyes of god.

This involved years of anxiety and depression, as you might imagine for someone coming to horrible realizations about what they've spent literal years devoting themselves to and also dealing with a mortality crisis. I went from having nearly perfect grades to failing classes.

I eventually came to the decision to leave BYU. I think this was the best decision. BYU was terrible for my mental health, and I don't want to have the slaving despot Brigham Young's name on my resume. Anyways, BYU kicks people out if they leave the church, and conducts mandatory yearly interviews where church loyalty and rules are enforced.

This puts me in a bind. I still have a 2 year degree with near perfect marks, but I was almost done with a mechanical engineering degree when I finished. Like I said, I failed classes so my record is fairly marred. I'm in my late twenties without real job experience, without a 4 year degree, and without capital. I'm trying to decide what's the best course.

I worked as a engineering research assistant for years, spent a summer abroad working as a Japanese intern, and have some awards and leadership positions. After a long emotional process my family has accepted me leaving the church, so I'm holed up at my parents house now. I’m extremely lucky in that regard.

**TL;DR I was raised mormon, went to a mormon school, left mormonism, left BYU before they could kick me out, but before I could graduate. Now I've got a two year degree, no capital, and a general awareness that I don't know much about life.**

###Questions

I’m trying to find a job. I hope to do medical research and eventually go into the biomedical field. How much or how little should I explain about my background, why I left school, why I failed classes, or the time gaps in my resume as I tried to recover my mental health?

What would you recommend in terms of looking for a job? I’m hoping to graduate in engineering at some point, but I want to be independent. I have credits from BYU that I could transfer, but I don’t know how the failed classes will be handled. Any advice on that?

Any advice on other subreddits or resources that you’d recommend? I’m familiar with the exmormon subreddits.

Thanks for reading this long post. Hope I'm not violating rule 6. I think that your advice would better with knowledge of the whole situation.",2018-08-01 03:01:15

40 and a bit lost. What do I even put on my resume?,35,8q7ert,"Kind of feeling a bit lost.

Looking to do something else but don't really know where to go or what to put on my resume.

In highschool and early college, I did a lot of freelance tech support to the point where I dropped out of college to keep up with the clients.

I pretty much still have intermediate to expert knowledge of Windows, Macs, iPhones, Android, networking, printers and smarthome devices, replacing PC parts and troubleshooting. I still keep up with all the latest gadgets and software. Never really got into programming besides basic editing html/css, WordPress, Joomla of websites we ran. I breeze through manuals and pick up things quickly but after saying all that, I'm not even sure if I like tech.

Doesn't seem like anything useful in a corporate environment and doesn't seem like there's any money to be made supporting consumers. I'm not afraid of hard work or apposed to starting at the bottom if there's room to grow or contacts to be made.

"Laid off, 34, and lacking skills; not sure where to go from here?",34,77eftz,"Several days ago, I was laid off from a position I had been at for a couple of years. I was known in the office as something of a punching bag for my boss's bad days anyway (at severe cost to my self-esteem), but in the end my work ended up being outsourced. So I am now 34, already struggling to save my marriage, and now I am confronted with the reality of needing to find a new career . . .with next to no definable career skills.

I have two degrees (bachelor's and master's); the first is in the liberal arts and the second a little more technical but not really practically useful either. The master's has a defined career path, I just chose not to take it at the time of graduation and it's a few years behind me.

In terms of things that I've done professionally: I previously worked as a web content project manager; essentially a liasion to other departments within the company, handling everything from basic HTML updates to photo editing to actual HTML/CSS builds. That too is several years behind me, so I am pretty out of date there. My most recent work (the one I just got canned from) involved doing digital web analytics and reporting on marketing data. Unfortunately my opportunities to develop my skills there never materialized as planned, so I'm essentially your typical Excel cheap tricks guy in that respect.

I was provided a moderate severance and have a low-cost living arrangement set up, so I have a little flexibility. I have actually been looking for a new job for quite a while, but I keep finding that companies just aren't interested in my specific skill base and experience level (although I consistently am told that I myself am very well-spoken and impressive in these interviews). 

I've been debating if it makes more sense at this point to try to return to school of some type and restart as a more data-oriented business analyst/analytics type, fulfilling that earlier promise. I love working with data, numbers and problem-solving, I just don't have any of the relevant skills to be on an analyst track let alone data science (which would be my dream).

Right now I'd be a marketing guy without specific marketing background, a web guy with intermediate (and outdated) technical skills, or a data guy who doesn't have programming/R/SQL/visualization skills. I'm confused about which way to turn, but I need to turn somewhere. Can anybody provide any advice about how to proceed? ",2017-10-19 16:41:13

Is it appropriate at all to talk to my manager about how burnt-out and exhausted I am?,34,6yn5ri,"I'm 27 years old, graduated college in 2012, and I've worked at the same place for 4 years. For the past year, starting January, I have been applying to other companies like crazy, with little to no response. I've truly fallen into a deep depression lately. I speak to no one at work. My work is unfulfilling, repetitive, boring. I really dislike my coworkers. I haven't learned anything new in over 3 years. I do maybe an hour of ""real work"" a day. The rest I spend on Reddit. I go home. I watch TV until I fall asleep. It takes a lot of energy for me to get up in the morning, to even get groceries or fill the gas tank in my car. I just don't want to do anything. It's just getting worse and worse. I hate my job. I hate my life. I just can't keep going like this. But in the past 9 months, I've gotten 3 interviews, no callbacks. I can't ""just quit."" I have financial obligations. And I've used up all my vacation and sick days for this year.

I work in HR. Is it appropriate for me to talk to my manager about how utterly miserable and burnt out I am? Is this just a ""me"" problem that has no place for the workplace? Or is it worth at least talking about? 

If I do talk to him... I don't know what kind of solution I'd want. It's not that I want different work, or more work. I don't want to work here at all. So maybe talking to him isn't really worth it.

Should I pursue a masters in Library Science or something else?,29,bpv1rv,"I received my bachelor’s in Linguistics four years ago.

My original plan was to attend law school and become a disability advocate. I am also fluent in ASL and wanted to join a local firm that works with the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. That did not pan out due to babies and I just don’t see myself attending law school anytime soon or taking on that huge debt now with two small kids. But I do not want to be a stay at home mom forever and need a career. 

My mom is suggesting I pursue a masters in Library Science and try to get a job in a elementary/high school. She was a teacher and she claims school librarians have the best job in the school. 

My other idea is to attend a one year certificate program to become a paralegal. That way I have my foot in the legal career door should I wish to attend law school down the road (I’m 26 right now). But I’ve heard that paralegals are worked to the bone and are under compensated. 

If anyone has any insight on either career that would be greatly appreciated! Or if anyone knows of a masters degree/career one can achieve with a “general” bachelor’s degree such as my Linguistics one. 

A good friend of mine is a speech pathologist and she said a Linguistics degree would be helpful for that, but the masters program and job field are extremely competitive and she is finding the pay is not great. She even had to take a second job to get by. So I’m not sure about that.

Left a good job that I loved to go into business with family and I hate it. Did I fuck up? How do I turn this around without ruining my reputation or resume? Or do I stick through it?,33,atzvh5,"Throwaway account just in case...

So, I was living out on my own in Colorado after a breakup with my ex who I started a photo/video company with specializing in concerts and events. He was basically draining my bank account, he had no money of his own and we racked up a lot of debt on my credit cards. I couldn't take it anymore and we split. I didn't want to pursue photography at the time so I switched my path and started making progress in a career toward marketing for the music industry. I paid to get a graphic design certification and was set on changing my career. I was working part-time temp jobs until I received a full time offer at a music venue back in New York (my home state). I was really happy with my progress.

I worked at a music venue for one month when my step-mom proposed the idea of me running this photography studio that my dad has been working at for the past 10 years. I have a background in photography and videography but left that career path when my ex and I broke up. She put a bit of pressure on me to decide, and I thought it was a great opportunity so I said yes. I was sad to leave the music venue and feel I let them down, I had friends there and a community of people and now it's very lonely at this studio. I have part ownership in the company by only verbal confirmation, I did not sign any papers, I'm getting not the greatest salary and yet the workload is all on me to run this thing. The payoff may be worth it to stick through it but I feel like my heart is not in it, and I was given a dying business to try and resuscitate. There is a lot more drama, I work directly with family, and I am becoming very depressed. I do not want to let my family down but I'm having a hard time seeing this business succeed with just me running it. 

Do I stick it out, or try to get out before it is too late? If I decide to get out now, how screwed will I be on my resume?

I had social anxiety and depression. I've been to a psychiatrist before, because public speaking back in early 2016 triggered my anxiety and another major depressive episode happened. It's been tough for me for the whole 2016 and 2017. 

I tried a call center job in the later part of 2017, but even just being on the phone, I still couldn't handle interacting with people. 

I'm fine now since I took a break. I had time to heal during 2018, but I've also been unemployed for quite some time. 

As of 2019, I'm now mentally and emotionally stable. It's just that when I started applying for jobs, self-doubt sometimes just creep in. It's not as bad as before when I was psychologically broken, but it's there. 

Any advice on how to overcome self-doubt when faced with applying for a job?",2019-01-31 16:07:43

I’m a college student studying CS. How do I know to follow my passion or pursue the cuchy Software Development career?,31,a3f1tl,"Edit: cushy* I meant cushy*

Hey friendos,

Apologies if this is a FAQ — lmk and I’ll try to post elsewhere as I’m a little confused / concerned about my current path and am seeking words of wisdom / guidance.

Currently a college student studying computer science at a small but highly selective liberal arts college (I bring this up because salary is correlated to connections and this school has tons). I’m currently working in BusDev at a startup in San Francisco (on a gap year) and in both my studies and my professional experience, I realized I’m not particularly interested in being paid for my mind. It gives me existential depression and intense anxiety.

I realize a computer science college grad with a successful business development background and coding skills has a valuable place in the market but I can’t shake the feeling that I’d be happier firefighting or bartending. I much prefer working lower on Maslov’s hierarchy as I find this to be much more rewarding.

Am I crazy for entertaining this? Will I regret pursuing these when I’m 28 / 29 and would prefer a desk job? 

My thoughts currently are to run a side UpWork coding gig and take the off ramp from firefighting and bartending later in my life when it’s profitable and I’d prefer to sit down more of the day.

Do you have thoughts? Career advice? I recognize this may come across as well thought out but I encourage you to critic at any point you feel is a weak spot as I have no idea if this line of thought is worth entertaining.

Best!

How do you improve your job interview skills?,34,96bctv,"I had an interview a couple of days ago for a job I had a recommendation for.  At the start, the potential employer seemed rather receptive, but towards the end, it kind of drifted.  I sent a thank you email after the fact, and two days later, the employer reached out to say they'd chosen someone else.  I felt awful - not just due to rejection but the fact I also let the person who recommended me down.

After some tough contemplation today, I know my interview skills need work.  I do really well in social settings with no obligation, but I think I go overboard in interviews, basically throwing myself at them.  This may stem from my previous college telling me to be over-confident in interviews and ""Dazzle them with \[your\] brilliance!"" (seriously).   Might have screwed up my skills.  Sadly I have no idea how to really improve this now.  My husband suggested practicing with him but I feel like I would act differently as I know him.  Did you ever struggle with interviews and how did you go about improving them?  How do you strike the right balance of attitude that they're looking for?

Would you except a 'counter-offer' with no salary increase?,34,8o86wc,"Hi folks,

I'm in a tricky position negotiation-wise and need to give my employer an answer by Tuesday, so I figured that I would reach out to the professionals in addition to some close friends.

I've been working at a 50 person tech startup for the past 16 months as a marketing communications ('marcom') manager.

Around seven months ago, I came to my boss explaining that I wasn't happy in the job.

There's very little variety in the work, I've never traveled the entire time, even domestically, no growth is happening happening, and although my title would suggest otherwise, I've basically treated as a glorified assistant to my boss. Meanwhile, I'm effectively doing all the non-graphic design work of the department (my job could realistically be divided among three people), while said boss takes credit for my work in meetings with the 'higher ups' that I and the rest of the small marketing team are continuously excluded from. Morale in the department, unsurprisingly, is abysmal and the overall atmosphere could be described as toxic.

Last week, I reached the point where I couldn't take any more (physical symptoms of stress have began to manifest while I'm in the office, namely headaches) and I handed in my resignation. Important to note: I've kept a freelance sideline going more or less since starting, and hence feel comfortable enough leaving a job without a firm offer on the table (it would be enough to pay rent and food and live paycheck to paycheck until I find another full time opening).

To cut to the chase, I get a private message from the CEO that afternoon (I quit on a Friday) saying that he wants to talk and see if I'd reconsider leaving the company.

When we meet on Monday morning, I'm told that they want to give me my boss's job and that she's being moved to another department (which would basically be a demotion).

The catch: there's no pay raise (I had to ask!), my title will remain the same, and they are not willing to even commit to a review after a certain period of time.

This to me seems like a really lousy 'deal'. Not only haven't I had a salary increase in the 16 months since I started my position (during which my responsibilities have increased, including taking on the work of the PR agency we were initially retaining), I'm now being asked to assume control of a department for the same compensation.

While I've read the threads online in which workers deliberate whether or not to accept a promotion without a pay rise, none seem to refer to facing that dilemma in the course of receiving a 'counteroffer' -- it seems a universal expectation that if an employer is going to try to convince you to stay, that they're going to put more money on the table, at the very least!

Again - I have enough freelance work on the table to get by without this job. And I've turned down an offer elsewhere recently which has bolstered my confidence that I'm still attractive to employers.

Should I accept this ludicrous deal for a few months or is the writing on the wall?

TIA in advance for all replies!",2018-06-03 15:24:01

Saving your job description for future resume updates? Not so fast.,33,6l139z,"HR Manager here. I see many posts on this sub advising to save job descriptions (JD) for positions you hold for the purpose of updating your future resume. There are merits to this, as you will have a well communicated description of your duties in any position. However, **please** do not simply copy and paste that damn thing into your resume description and think the job is done. That is perceived as lazier than leaving ""insert address here"" on the template resume you just pulled off Google.

Also, to the same point, dont rely on the JD to write your resume for you. I'm sure many of us can attest to the fact that the line that says ""other duties as assigned"" can mean *a shit load* and its that experience that can differentiate you from another candidate.

TL;DR - Dont rely on the your JD to make a resume. Use it as a last resort, after you have described the position in its reality. ",2017-07-03 19:54:25
What can I do/learn in the next 2-3 years to increase my per hour income and be able to work part time and/or from home? (x-post /personalfinance),29,6guc1n,"TL/DR:  In 2-3 years, I plan to have kids. How can I increase my value to be able to work part time and/or from home, while raising kids? What fields & career paths should I consider?

Hello! I'm recently engaged, and trying to plan for the future. My fiance works for the local government, which has specific salaries per job title. I know that he won't be climbing the ranks at an above average pace, and I'm not sure what his maximum salary will be. Right now he makes about 125% what I make at my admin & accounting assistant job (we're both in our mid-20s, if you're wondering). We live in a high COL area, but should be able to comfortably afford a 1-2 bedroom apartment on both of our salaries. The catch is, we plan to start having kids in 2-3 years, and it's really important to me to be able to raise my own kids (no judgement on those who use nannies, but my mom was a SAHM, and that's something I really value.)

I know that we won't be able to afford to live on just his income, and I would like to stay on a good foot financially, while being able to stay at home with the kids at least half of the time. My ideal would be to be able to make what I do now at 20 hours/week instead of 40, and/or be able to do work from home, so I could at least take breaks from work to be with the kids.

I'm taking a certified bookkeeper course this fall, but I'm not optimistic that that will really increase my per hour income potential. I've considered, but not too heavily researched, getting a Masters in accounting, to certify to take the CPA exam, but I currently have 0 accounting or business credits, so I'm worried about the time investment, especially since I'd prefer to keep working while I go back to school.

I know reddit recommends computer science a lot, but unlike everyone here, I have virtually no idea what programming entails, like what programming languages do what kind of things, and what kinds of jobs that would lead to. The only ""experience"" I have is some self-teaching of a few Excel functions, and I messed around a bit with Microsoft Access once. I do enjoy working with Excel, but from what I gather, it would be tons of work over the next few years to learn cs skills that would maybe qualify me to work in a field that seems like it is likely pretty saturated.

Also, I have no idea whether either of those two fields has many part-time options or work from home options. Do any of you have any suggestions? I like working with numbers, and I'm a pretty quick learner. I have a Bachelor's in music, but don't like teaching, and really wish I had majored in something more useful. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",2017-06-12 22:00:57
In 2016 I applied to 1000 positions in software and received zero job offers. What do I do now?,36,67vgd0,"Dear Friends,

Over the past year starting December of 2015 I have been searching for employment. This article describes my job search. My job search started out as a normal search for employment, but as I submitted more and more applications I noticed the number of applications continually growing. By early 2017 I had submitted 1000 job applications and received zero job offers in the field of software. It may be hard to conceptualize the amount of applications I submitted. I would appreciate if people could take a moment and imagine applying to 1000 jobs. If you are able to, actually visualize that number and what time and effort that would take. Try and visualize reaching the 10 mark, then 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, then double it. This is a tremendous amount of applications. I am a qualified software engineer with many years of experience. Several of my friends and associates that I have worked with seem to have no problems obtaining employment. Some of my previous co-workers are surprised to learn that I have had difficulties obtaining employment. I usually did not receive much feedback from potential employers. When I did receive feedback from a potential employer regarding candidacy for a position, the feedback was usually positive and not specific. We have all applied for a job before. Personally, I have probably had more than a dozen jobs in my life. On my resume I list 7 jobs. Each one of those jobs did not take 1000 applications but probably only a dozen or so. With each position I have continued to gain knowledge in my field and also improved interpersonal and social skills. What I am communicating is I am much more qualified now than when I took my first, second, and even third jobs and so on.

I applied to positions using the following resources:

* craigslist.org
* indeed.com
* monster.com
* dice.com
* linkedin.com
* Washington state employment office
* directly on employers websites

Background information about me that I believe is relevant to this article:

* I have nearly ten years of relevant industry experience in the software field.
* I have a portfolio of numerous successful software engineering projects.
* I have a bachelor of science degree.
* I have no disabilities.
* I have no criminal record.
* I am an honorably discharged Army National Guard veteran (employers want to hire veterans).
* I have a professionally created and refined resume.

The interview process with employers usually started out with a technical phone interview. After the initial interview there were usually several other follow-up interviews. Some employers requested a skill examination or a coding problem as part of the interview process. When feedback was given I received positive feedback on all of these. I had many 3rd and 4th round interviews with employers.

The types of responses I got from employers usually fell into the following categories:

* The position for which you applied is no longer available.
* Not a good fit.
* It came down to you and one other person.
* Decided to go a different direction

During the 2016 year it is difficult to estimate the time spent on interviews with employers. I estimate that I spent up-to 20 hours a week just interviewing with employers some weeks. The job application process was a monumental task in itself. I received confirmation emails with the majority of my applications showing they were received. I have contacted all three of my most recent employers and asked if they have disclosed any information about me to potential employers. All three of my past employers replied to my emails and stated that they have not disclosed any information about my past employment to anyone. I have a highly rated expert profile in a computer programming language. I do not have any type of criminal record or anything I know about that would cause employers not to hire me. I have been promoted several times in my previous positions and have received increased yearly salaries at all three of my last employers. I have also received several positive periodic performance reviews from my places of employment. The applications I submitted were in a few different geographic locations. Toward the end of 2016 I applied to several entry level positions and other positions that I believe I was overqualified for.  I have taken a lot of time to study communication and language strategies for interviews. When I did have an in-person interview I was always well groomed, prepared, on time, and professional. Does it pass a common sense test that with all of this knowledge and experience I do not receive a single job offer after 1000 applications? What has changed? Is it possible that there are other factors besides my personal resume and interview? Who here like myself has taken a statistics class? Based on the knowledge I have, something does not seem right about this scenario. I think most rational people would agree with me. Thank you for reading this article and comments are welcome.",2017-04-27 16:04:09
Resume Builder | Get Hired in 30 Seconds: Resume Tips,37,1qn5yp,"While most hiring managers honestly believe they’re giving each resume fair and equal consideration, this isn’t always the case. Mangers are human beings, and no matter how hard they try to be objective, they sometimes give a resume a ten-second glance and they just…know. Even before they reach the “education” or “work history” sections, they’ve already formed a strong first impression.

And this first impression sets the stage for whatever information reveals itself next. If reviewers like this candidate on a gut level, the rest of the resume will have to include some fairly damning information to push the applicant out of the running. And if the first glace casts shadows or doubts on the candidate, the rest of the page will have to present some serious pros in order to make the cons fall away.

In other words, the first glance can make or break the success of the entire application. Here are a few ways to use this quirk of the hiring process to your advantage:

1. Summary, summary, summary. The summary of a resume is like a movie trailer: It’s the quick version—the promo—that sells you. And because of the way we absorb information in our modern world, most reviewers begin reading the summary with only question in mind: “Will I or will I not be interested in reading further?” They’re looking for only one thing: A reason to keep an open mind as they read on.

2. Even a summary has a summary. Make the first sentence of your summary say—or at least suggest—everything about you that your readers must know. Back in the days of print journalism, reporters kept a rule of thumb in mind: Put the whole story in the first line. That is, the beginning of the story, the middle, and the end.

3. Cut to the chase. And in this case, the chase isn’t just about what you can do and what you have to offer. It’s about what you can do that other applicants can’t. Here’s how to rank your information: The body of the resume contains evidence to support the claims of the summary. The summary contains the primary claim. And the primary claim tells the reviewer why you should be hired instead of the next candidate in line.

4. Focus on tone, not just content. While you keep your summary statements lean and devoid of fluff, make sure you keep one eye on the tone of your phrases and sentences. Do you sound like someone who’s smart and self-directed? Do you sound confident? Do you sound trustworthy? A strong command of the language suggests a person who’s ready to take on a high level of responsibility.

5. Don’t accidently undermine yourself. Remove words and language like “try” or “might” or “almost” or “probably.”

6. Set the terms. Know exactly what you want from this transaction before you begin to write. Don’t just tell the reviewer that you’re capable of handling whatever’s asked of you. Show her—in concrete terms—what you want this relationship to look like.

Great Resumes Are Impossible to Ignore

They’re also impossible to put down. And once managers put them down, they’re impossible to forget. Keep your resume at the top of the list by grabbing your reviewer’s attention from the very first line. Visit LiveCareer to create a resume that grabs hiring managers’ attention and leads to more job offers.",2013-11-14 23:26:14

How to know which career is right for you?,33,arl5gq,"Hey guys, I'm new to this sub so please bare with me.

I'm currently 22, and living with my girlfriend. My relationship/family/personal life are great, but I frequently feel lost or empty in life. I feel like the largest contributing factor to this feeling is that I'm at a loss for which career to try and persue.

What I do know is that I'm really interested in health and nutrition. I like working with others as well as helping people out whenever I can.

I'm currently a volunteer firefighter, so I've considered pursuing that as a career for the reasons mentioned above, and have in fact placed an application to a nearby school for it. 

However I've recently started second guessing this decision because landing a job in that field will more than likely result in me having to move, who've my partner refuses to do.

I've also considered to take an electrical engineering course at my local university/college. I've always had an interest in technology and how it works so I feel like that could be a good fit, however I wasn't a very academic or 'mathy' kid in highschool, so I would definitely need to go back for academic upgrades.

Another thing I've considered is trying to become a highschool teacher. Even though I wasn't very academic, I still enjoyed the atmosphere in highschool. Plus with the option to specialize in health or physical education at my local university, it makes it feel like a much more diverse option for a career instead of a straight up nutrition or kinesiology degree.

When I graduated highschool in 2015, I went into a 2 year computer programming course right away, and dropped out near the end of my second year there. I feel that because of my age and immaturity at the time, plus having no financial stake in the course, that it contributed to me not taking the course seriously and just sliding by for a period of time before I ultimately dropped out.

That being said though, I feel that with my added life experience and maturity since graduation, that I could end up successful in a university setting, but it's none the less still extremely intimidating for me.

I live in DFW and I'm really not that interested in going into the Oil and Gas Industry anymore (I don't even work in it plus all the positions here require TONS of experience) and I would rather get into something else that I can use my MBA in also like Finance or possibly Data/IT management. I just feel that when recruiters (or the ATS) read over my resume, I get looked over because many companies have had employees leave them for O&G jobs during the Booms due to the money and it's left a bad taste in their mouth. I think them seeing that I have a degree specific for O&G makes them skittish before they even get the chance to get to talk to me.

Thanks for any responses you might leave!

tl;dr: Is it bad to change my major on the resume to a simpler form/version to get recruiters to talk to me?",2019-02-07 15:54:10

Imposter Syndrome?,31,ajj44v,"Hey everyone. I started a job a few months back in banking as an analyst (basically I do reviews of various federal regulations and make sure we are in compliance with the law). It's exciting and I get to learn about new laws and examinations every day. The problem is, I learn NEW things every day. Each regulation has it's own test and procedures, so it's like every project is my first day all over again. 

I've heard nothing but good things said about my work ethic and yet I still am riddled with anxiety that I'll get fired or it's all a facade and I actually suck at this. I'm new to banking so I have to ask a LOT of questions (since it's all otj and no education department) and I often feel like a liability. 

I know rationally I should just chalk it up as ""well my boss says I'm good, so I'm good"" but emotions arent always rational. Has anyone been felt like this and if so how did you eventually get over it? ",2019-01-25 02:12:58
Where do I go from here?,35,aim1h8,"I'm (soon to be 35/M) whose currently in school for an MBA in business intelligence/data analytics and about to be married in October.

Everything is going good in my life. I have a good job, not great paying, but considerable amount of downtime to do reading and school work, as well as overtime availability. Right now, I'm just focused on paying off the wedding by doing overtime and finishing this semester of classes. I have 6 more to go, until I get my degree. I could stand to lose some weight, but with my sleep schedule (due to working overnight) and class schedule it makes it rather difficult.

My real concern is that although everything seems to be grounded for me. I still feel lost. It's like everything I'm doing makes sense for any normal person. I should feel accomplished. It wasn't too long away, that I had a severe breakdown and was hospitalized. Some of my close friends, thought my life was over and that I'll never get back to normal. Yet, though all that I've been able to get my life together. Looking back now, it seems like a life time ago...

Here I am now embarking on the greatest journey in my life and doubt just plagues it. Not doubt of the person I love, but of the career that my fall in front of me. To be honest, from a young age I was a romantic when it came to my career. When I was younger I wanted to be a cartoonist, until a shitty junior high art school teacher threw negativity my way. Then around high school, I dug deeper and discovered my love for the movies after taking a film class. The plan was to get a bachelor's in film production and get work in the industry. I followed through, earned my degree and was ""working"" for a small production company right after film school. Problem was the people I was working for were running me ragged and barely paying me for my services. I thought naturally that this is how it was and eventually paying gigs will come. What really happened was that these people cozied up to me and took advantaged of me.   


One thing, I didn't see coming was the drug problem that was beginning to form, while in their employ. After shoots, we would head over to their apartment, smoke some weed, do some coke and then smoke the coke with the weed. Granted in hindsight, I should have seen this as a complete no no, but I was young and stupid and passionate and insert bullshit excuse here. So, they ran me ragged and to the point I had a nervous breakdown in my car and was taken into custody by the police and ambulance. The next year and a half was the worst time I've ever had in my life. I couldn't work, because of the small community I was working knew what happened to me and that made me a liability. I was living with my parents, whom I am eternally grateful for taking care of me, while I heard their disappoint cries for me in the middle of the night.

The only way I was able to get myself back on track was by walking, alot of walking. Not like the Forrest Gump type, but enough that my mind which was racing a hundred miles an hour and I was able to slow it down after a grueling, sometimes painful walk. I ended up going back to one of my first job during college. It was a real humility tour. Going back may have been the motivator for me to better myself. Fast forward today, I have my own place, which I share with my lovely soon-to-be wife. Yet, there's something at the back of my head that's telling me things aren't complete yet.  


I know that finding one's calling isn't something that you can take a course on or read a book about. It's an instinct that's deep within you and it will manifest itself some way or another. The original plan was to do a simple post, but obviously I fucked that up. People post here all the time looking for advise, guidance or some sort of barometer of where they should be heading. I know we're not all meant to be rock-stars or beauty-queens, but that's not what I'm asking for. I don't know what will make me happy career-wise, so I'll settle on content for now. With all my heart and energy, I will find some peace of mind. Whether it comes from within or from outside, I'll make sure to have my mind open and heart ready. I'd like other people to know that one day, you and I will discover something that will bring us joy. There's hope for those out there lost at sea.",2019-01-22 13:42:13
I'm debating to leave my job but people are telling me not to?,32,ahnple,"Hi all, I just need a little clear minded folks to give me some knowledge on what to do... but first, some context:

I have a degree in management but i went into a different field where it's more on the job training.  I went into this career path thinking it was a temporary thing and I've tried a few times getting out, but it was all contract jobs where in the end, I just fell back into the old job I was working for. (I'm not gonna specify the exact job I'm doing now) . I'm not gonna lie, the money is more than enough for a comfortable life.

Now that I'm about 6 to 10 years into this (early 30s) I realised that alot of my mood swings, depressive episodes, panic attacks came from doing this job. So I bit the bullet this year (2019!) And decided to quit. But now, I have colleagues in the same field advising me not to quit and to stay on, and that wherever I go, there are no prospects. The company I quit doesn't want to let me go either saying they will give me a month's break then I can come back anytime (still refusing to acknowledge my resignation) telling people I'm coming back after a few months. (Its part time and they can slot me back to my timeslot at any given week)

I have absolutely made up my mind when I quit that I am leaving the industry for good, but now I'm not too sure what to do. Should I:

A) stay on until I find a permanent job?

B) just quit and find anything that comes by... I'm not picky

C) get other jobs that are in the related field, risk all these emotions and shit to come back into my life again.

Again I wanna stress a few things: I wanna look for something that relates to my degree, and all i can see right  now is to just leave this industry if u know how i feel... just looking for advice on what you would do?

Thanks again for reading this long post. I hope someone can reply!",2019-01-19 18:50:30

How do I approach my manager about requesting a day off to attend my university's career fair that he potentially knows about?,33,9c7d4d,"So, I'm a senior in college and just did an internship this summer for the company I am working for. The agreement is to work for them part time while I attend my last semester at school. I really do like working at this company and the topic of me being hired to work full time after I graduate has come up multiple times and I also have an interview scheduled for a full time position in 2 weeks. However sure this offer might sound it's not there until I receive it. For this reason and for the reason that I'd like to have more than one option when I make that decision, I would like to attend my university's career fair. The problem is that I am scheduled to work on Wednesdays and the career fair event is on a Wednesday (about 2 weeks after my interview). Considering that the company I work for attends the career fair every semester, I know that my manager is aware of what day it is on. How do I go about discussing with him to work on Tuesday that week instead of Wednesday so that I can go to the career fair without making it awkward or lowering my chances at getting an offer from them? By the way I graduate in December so this is my last semester at school so this career fair is important.",2018-09-02 01:51:48
How do I Avoid Termination at the First Step of my Career?,35,94md65,"I am 6 months into my first full-time role at this company that I've also had 2 internships at. There is no official training or official documentation/how-to guides on processes. I shadowed someone for a few weeks and was then fully transitioned. I am finding myself having to work at least 10 hours a day to make a dent in the workload but I am still unable to complete everything I need. I've had to work for a few hours every weekend as well. My inability to find a path towards success has become apparent to my boss. 

I met with him last week and my suspicions have been confirmed. I'm on my way to getting fired unless I figure out how to succeed here. The only option I see is simply, work more hours. I don't know what to do long term though. Should I seek work elsewhere? Should I suck it up and deal with it until I can move departments? I need to survive until early next year, else I'll have to give back the bonus I had received. These past 6 months maybe have been the lowest I've experienced so far. My depressions seems to have no bottom to it as I feel further and further away from any semblance of satisfaction, professionally or socially. I feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown and am struggling with maintaining my sanity as the prospect of termination is crushing and absolute.

What are expected hours for salaried employees?,32,8ly186,"I got a new job three months ago, and the hours that they quoted in the interview and in the job offer are not matching my bosses expectations.

"Have an interview for my dream job. I also have slight vocal/motor tics and slight sudden movements, similar to Tourettes.

I have motor tics (some coughs, throat clears, etc.) Depending on time of day, they can be louder or quieter. I also sometimes move my arms or twitch slightly. It's never affected my ability to perform work to a high degree in the past nor has it affected co-workers' concentration. I am going to try my best to control it throughout the interview.

"How can I tactfully ask my male employers why my lower performing male colleague, who has worked at the company and in the industry for less time than I have, receives a higher salary and bigger raises than I do?",33,1xh1cj,"I work in sales and marketing, and the output of people in my position are very clearly quantifiable, basically, the amount of money we make for the company. We are given targets which we are expected to meet, presumably based on past performance. The company sets realistic targets based on what they think employees can achieve.
My colleague joined the company one year ago, and I joined two years ago. The target I have even set for this year is 1.5x what was expected of him. I know that last year, I had a similar target to what i have now, i trained him, and I achieved figures of 2-3x (possibly more, i know his performance was fairly slow in the first year, which my boss mentioned to me was a concern, but dont know actual figures)what he did.
I was chatting to him about salaries competing companies pay, and he told me he was very happy with his pay here, and that he was paid 'mid thirties' salary, and had received a raise of 20 percent, and that it was a very pleasant surprise. So, I know he did not ask for or negotiate that salary, and I know he is quite meek and probably would not ask for more if he was given a raise.
I earn low thirties, and the last two years have earned a ten percent raise each time. I concealed my shock when he informed me, but it has been bothering me for days.
I would like to know the most tactful and constructive way of asking my employers what their reasons for this are, as I cannot see any logical reason they would reward him more for lower performance, other than they just assume he would expect more, possibly because he is older, possibly because he is male.
I am annoyed, obviously. I feel that I have been ripped off.
Te situation is slightly complicated by the fact I have been made a new job offer and will be leaving soon. They made it clear that I was valuable to the company and offered me all kinds of things when I told them I had been made a better offer from another company. I my final few weeks I am expected to help my better paid colleague and make sure he is prepped to take on all my projects. Basically, I am being paid less, and have to work harder to achieve targets which will entitle me to a lower bonus.
I do not want to rule out returning to this company to work in a ore senior position, and since I will be working in the same industry and do not want to burn any bridges. So, I don't want to go in all belligerent and say 'It's because I am a woman, isn't it!?'
I will probably frame it by saying that I would like to know if they had any criticisms of me and how I worked, and that it would be very helpful for me and my career if they could tell me honestly, and mention that I am aware of the fact that he and I are being rewarded differently, despite me being expected to perform more, and having shown I perform more.
I expect I will get some bs about how this isn't appropriate to discuss, and that it is a decision that is different for every employee, and not give me a proper answer.
Can anyone give any advice on how to approach this? I feel let down and a bit upset, and feel that I need an answer, and would like this not to happen in the future. I am good at my job and am looking forward to my new post, but i wonder if there is something about me that gives the impression that i would expect less. most of my peers are male, and older, although i know i can perform just as well as them, and am fairly well respected in the industry.
Are there any bosses reading this who might be able to enlighten me as to what the reasons might be? If they give me a bs answer what is the best way to push for a real answer without pissing them off? Is there a chance it is because I am a woman, or is that unlikely?
By the way, I feel no animosity towards the colleague himself, I enjoy working with him and think he is a genuinely nice guy, and I think he is just as competent as I am, but he needs a little more time to build his networks. Even if they see him as having more future potential, it doesn't make sense that they would pay him more and raise him more in a year where they give him a lower target than I.",2014-02-10 01:43:46

What secular careers are there that would be a natural transition from Music Ministry?,30,akqxb1,"As the question suggests, I am looking to transition out of ministry and into the secular workforce. 

I am currently a music minister in a Church of Christ, which does not use instruments, so I’m not proficient in any instrument, but I do have a better than average singing voice. I’m only 26, but I’ve been doing this for about 5 years now (2 years full time).

I have a music degree in Vocal Performance, but the world of opera or musical theater are out of the question for me because of the travel and time commitment involved that would take me away from my family.

I’m not interested in teaching, nor am I a good teacher anyway, so I don’t feel teaching in a school setting or a private lesson setting full time is really an option.

What I currently do well at my job - collaborate with others on 2 weekly services (Wednesday and Sunday), plan a service of music and other elements that flows smoothly and has a storyline/theme to it, create visually appealing presentations using a powerful presentation software, stand on the stage with a microphone and lead people in the singing with great enthusiasm and musicality. The last item here is what people often tell me how good I am at what I do. I do manage people in my job, but honestly it’s a weak point for me.

I won’t go into the reasons I’m wanting to transition out, but I’m looking for something in the secular workforce where the skills I have developed can be used hopefully without a drastic pay cut. 

I also have other interests and passions, but nothing that I have skills or knowledge in. I’m not afraid of going back to school should I need to, but ideally I get myself out of the religious sect first, then begin to focus on something that might take a handful of years to do.

I know this is broad. Please help me by allowing me to answer more specific questions for you if I can.

"27, unemployed for 7 months, will this gap haunt me forever?",29,ag3yyi,"Hey all. So I graduated with bachelors in biology last year, and landed a short term research position right after. However, I did horribly at this position because I was very depressed. The job technically ended in May 2018, but I did go in a bit over the summer and fall on a volunteer basis. But I don't think I can put this in my resume. The research generated some media interest, and I gave a TEDx talk on it a few months ago. Former boss and I filed for a patent, but there was a nasty battle over rights, which made me even more burnt out. I have basically been lying to family and friends, saying I've been volunteering in lab finishing this project (which is partially true) up until now. I had a few lab job offers over the summer, but I didn't apply because I was incredibly burnt out.  I worried if I took them, I'd get fired. My head was not in a good place. I started seeing a therapist. My dad was also arrested and diagnosed with Alzheimer's leading to an insanely stressful and lengthy family affair. It's eaten up a lot of my time.

However, I have technically been unemployed for 7 months, with the exception of an occasional babysitting gig and some postmates driving but nothing to put on a resume. I have enough money to live on for now through family investments, but it won't last forever. I have no customer service experience, only lab experience, with a gaping resume gap, and my former boss isn't a reliable reference.

I want to work in healthcare, but without that reference, and with such a huge employment gap, I'm struggling to find anything. Since I have no customer service experience, I can't even find work in a basic part time job to help tide me over.  I'm working on my typing skills and enrolling in a Medical terminology class to improve my chances of scribe work, but again, this employment gap and lack of reference is haunting me. I am looking at professional certifications like phlebotomy or a nursing assistant cert but I'm worried my lack of experience and resume gaps will follow me into these fields and I'll be in the same position I am now. Same for EMT work. And the trades. I feel like I'm in a really deep hole here, and I don't know how to climb out. I really shot myself in the foot by taking time off.

Best Path to grad school for a computer science degree with no current background for it?,32,ae7y6c," **Background:**

I graduated in 2013 from a University of California (one of the top 40 schools in the country) with a really shit Gpa, like under 2.5 shitty, with a degree in Sociology.

I have since addressed these issues and am doing fine now.

Basically, at 28yrs old, my parents are pushing me out of living at home with them. So I need to move as well. I have a couple of options, but am struggling to make a decision and figure out which one will put me on the best path. 

&#x200B;

I have about $9k saved. I have a separate account of $9k to pay for the majority of my car lease which has two years left on the lease. I have about $5k invested in either stocks or a traditional IRA. I have about $5k in debt that I should be able to have down to $4k or below by the end of Feb. I need to move either in Feb or March of this year. 

&#x200B;

My plan, either way, is to work part-time in the area I move to, and possibly even online while studying. And take out student loans for the rest. 

&#x200B;

**Option 1:** 

Move to the Sacramento, CA area (which is way cheaper than where I currently live and has family close by). 

&#x200B;

I can take some supplemental community college courses and do the OSU program. 

&#x200B;

Then apply for a computer science masters program at in-state schools (and out-of-state, but due to costs I would prefer to stay in-state for this option). With my main choice being Sacramento State University. 

&#x200B;

The cost of living isn’t too bad for the area. I think that there would be some decent internship availability for the city. And it’s got several good schools in the area that have comp science grad degrees. 

&#x200B;

The pros for this is the area expenses. Car insurance would probably be lower than if I went with option 2. Food prices should be lower as well. Most places in the area I’m looking at don’t charge pet rent, just a deposit. Parking is included and not extra. 

&#x200B;

**Option 2:**

&#x200B;

Move to the Bothell, WA area. The Seattle area is ultimately my dream location to live in, and where I would eventually like to end up anyway. 

&#x200B;

The University of Washington Bothell has a graduate certificate program in Computer Science that is designed to prepare students who lack formal computer science training to succeed in their master’s program. It says on their website that 50% of people who do that certificate go on to the Grad program. 

&#x200B;

I think that given my background going for the grad certificate would be a good way to get my foot in the door for a masters. They get to know me, and I get to prove I can do the work. I should still have time to apply for Fall 2019 admission, and that program is about 9 months, and I can go for the masters after that. I should have two OSU program courses and two community college courses done by the time I apply for the certificate. 

&#x200B;

The pros for this one is I get to be in my ideal location, I kind of feel like I wouldn’t put down roots in Sacramento as my thinking is it would be temporary anyway. But the main concern is the cost of living in the Bothell area. Most places seem to charge for parking and pet rent plus deposit. If I’m in Bothell I would need to keep my car. 

&#x200B;

**Option 3 (Or the in-between option):**

&#x200B;

Move to Portland, OR. It’s kind of in-between cost of living for Sacramento and Seattle. It’s the Pacific Northwest, which I love. 

&#x200B;

Portland State University has their own post-bachelors program and a grad prep program that I could take to help me get into a masters program. University of Washington Vancouver is also close by. I feel that the internship opportunities are about even with Sacramento, but probably not as good as the Seattle area can offer. 

&#x200B;

It’s sort of the middle ground option for me. Not quite the leap Bothell is, but not the “safe-space” California offers. I get the outdoor playground of the Cascades, but I’ve never had to deal with snow before. 

&#x200B;

My plan is to apply to grad schools in Montana, California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona, and Texas as well. I feel like that way I have a good blanket of schools and would hopefully get into one of them. 

&#x200B;

I feel like I fucked up with my first degree. That I was too young and had no clue what I wanted to do, but was more or less pressured into it by my parents at the time. It was a great source of pride for their kid to go to a UC. But I didn’t appreciate it, and I was just not ok after the first year. 

&#x200B;

So I feel a great deal of pressure not to fuck this up too. And if I do then I’m going to be screwed with debts. ",2019-01-09 17:36:49
How do I go back to school to become a therapist?,29,a6lfd0,"Hi all! Like the title of this post states - I really want to go back to school to become a cognitive behavioral therapist. It’s been a calling for me that I’ve tried to ignore, but I honestly can’t ignore it anymore.  I have my bachelors degree already, in History of Art (wanted to work in museums, worked in a museum, realized it really wasn’t what I wanted). I was a preschool teacher for a while after college, now work for a startup in customer service.  In the past three-ish years since I’ve graduated, I’ve been debating going back to school - but honestly I’m having a lot of trouble deciding if I should take on more debt in student loans or pay for it out of pocket as I go. My family has no money to help, and if it takes a few extra years to get the funds to pay for school, then I’m fine with that.  I guess the advice I need is - what’s the smartest way to go about this? I have a basic Psych and Sociology class under my belt from undergrad, I’ve looked up so programs in the colleges in my city - I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed on how to go for this. Any advice is appreciated!",2018-12-16 04:33:51
Should I move forward with my new job or stay at my current job?,30,a2340v,"Hello, I just want to thank anybody that reads this and gives me any advice to what I should do.

Current/ex job: So I actually quit yesterday morning, but they have given me the weekend to change my mind and act like it never happened. I currently sell mortgage loans, refinancing and purchase loans, been with the company 1.5 years. I have a base pay that can fluctuate every quarter + monthly bonuses that stem from my loan volume each month. My YTD as of yesterday is $67,000. I’ve had many ups and downs with the company, have been extremely stressed out, work 7 days a week (off the clock) due to the pressure of constantly hitting my numbers and submitting loans as it directly affects my pay. I’ve seen many close friends leave for various reasons so I began to look for a new job a couple months ago.

When I quit, I had multiple managers from different divisions reach out to rehire me, along with multiple VPs reach out to try and bring me back. They’ve made it clear they want and need me as this year I’m #16 out of 300 people at my position. They said they would be willing to help work on the problems i listed or fix them outright. They said they wished i came to them sooner so it wouldn’t have gotten to this point.

New job: Salary job - $65,000/year. Id be working for a marketing company that’s hired by other companies. Id essentially have a territory in my state, talk with business owners as to why they should offer the product and leave. Not signing up or closing a sale with said people. Seems much easier, less stressful, 9-5 job with no weekends.

I know the new job I accepted is less than what I’ve made through 11 months, but with the mortgage company the base pay can and will change each quarter depending on the amount of loans I close. There’s no guarantee in pay, I’ve just had a great year. 

I have until tomorrow night to decide if i move forward with the new job or go back. I just need an outside perspective on this. Thank you!

Update: I just want to thank everyone, I read each comment throughout the day. I was very confident with my choice up until I actually did it yesterday and had everyone from work talking in my ear about coming back. My gut was/is to move on and your outside perspectives along with my families’ have only confirmed that for me.",2018-12-01 15:43:18
"Bachelor's in Biology to Master's in Accounting, but I'm making $40k/year for a medical company in an administrative role. Should I still go for my Master's?",33,9j0tbl,"TL;DR: see title

Hi all,

I graduated in May 2017 with Bachelors in Biology and was planning to become a Physician Assistant. That didn't work because my science GPA was too low, so I'm currently taking accounting classes in community college to fulfill the prerequisites to obtain a Masters in Accounting. I'm planning to apply to Masters program by the end of 2019 and to be enrolled by Fall 2020.

I was recently hired by a medical company (a government contractor company) and will be working in an office environment making $40k/year in PA/NJ urban area. It's a really great opportunity for me but it's not accounting related. I'd have to be in my current position (administrative role with extensive knowledge in biology) for a year first before I can apply for another position within the company.

Here is my question for you, Reddit:
- Should I continue working in my current position, forget about Masters in Accounting, and just climb the ladder for a higher position in this medical company, or
- Should I keep my current plan to be enrolled in an accounting Masters program by Fall 2020 and risk not getting a job after I graduate because I don't have a prior accounting experience? 

Another option I was thinking of working in my current administrative job for a year first, then apply to an internal accounting position, work in that position for a year, and then go for my Masters. However I feel like a higher position in this medical company would be around the same as an entry level accountant (~$50-55k). My other concern is that getting a Masters degree means more loans (I already have $25k from undergrad).

I know I should pursue the field that I like best, but I like biology and accounting equally. I just need to work in an office environment and I'm good.

EDIT: I lied about liking biology and accounting equally -- I like accounting more due to the office environment. I'm also planning to take my CPA exams while I do my masters because the grad school around here focus on preparing students for the CPA exams. I will NOT be working at all while I attend a masters program though, hence my worry about getting an accounting job without a prior experience in the field -- unless can I get an internship while/after I do my masters of course. I was thinking of doing an online MAcc/MS but I value a classroom environment better and the schools around here are recruited by the B4 (I'm only planning to stay there for a few years, don't worry).",2018-09-26 11:59:38
Afraid of being fired for lack of training should I be concerned?,31,9bc6z8,"I started a new position as a supply manager. I didn’t come from the industry and they knew this and I work alone in office as a one person team. Boss is in another country. 
When I started my boss was out for 3 weeks. I was shown around by HR then given a computer and just pretty much sat waiting for three weeks. There was one hour I sat with one person who doesn’t do what I do and then I sat with a high up who showed me one system for 30 mins then he left to go back to his country. No tasks given.
I keep reaching out asking around and trying to figure things out but after 2 months of nothing I lost motivation. No one responds to emails or even questions, calls or anything bc they are so busy. 
I make a lot so I can’t complain but I really don’t know my role at This point. 
I got a random urgent request for more suppliers from the CEO. So I jumped on it, I thought it was a simple question to ask in what areas do they need and I’ll figure everything else out. The response why an IDK and then to ask someone else. It’s been 2 weeks since I was told this was urgent and no one has told me what we even need. Am I just not doing a good job or is this wrong?

I mean I could figure out the industry and everything but I need to at least understand what services I need. 
I found a bunch but get no responses from my  own company how to set them up or what to do once Interested.
My last industry they at least had a process that they explained. Idk here. I can’t just agree to something with a supplier without someone guiding once right? 
No responses to emails but I’m afraid I’ll get fired bc I’ve completely lost motivation to do anything not having any answers. 
I just sit on my phone lately because I can’t really act on what I found because I have no idea what to do next. Afraid I’m going to be fired.
I keep setting up call times with my boss but he’s so busy he has postponed it a month now. 

I just started so I hate to just give up and have a 4 month job on my resume. I also can’t take time off to interview until I’ve been here 6 months.  I’m also trying to plan a trip with my fiancé bc i haven’t had more than two days off in 7 yrs and I just want to stay long enough for some PTO but feel uneasy and insecure about how I’m doing here.....

-I want a job that I genuinely enjoy. One of my deepest desires in life is to be excited about my work. I hear something like ""horse trainer"" and think that sounds like a dream. I don't know shit about horses but that just sounds serene and awesome

-I want it to pay the bills (obviously), but that's it. i don't want my job to be my life in a bad way. If I genuinely enjoy my work so much that it becomes a passion, then awesome!

How do I tell my boss (that I like) that I am leaving my job (that I also like)?,31,8doy60,"I need some advice.

An unexpected job opportunity came up in the last week that is too good to turn down. I love my job, the people I work with, my boss.. I wasn't even looking, it just kind of found me, and I'd be a fool to turn it down (more money, flexible schedule, work from home some days, office is closer to home when I need to go in). The company is great- I know several people who work there, which is how they found me.

It's killing me a bit to tell my current boss I'm leaving. I have so much respect for her and the organization.. most advice is centered around leaving for a reason.. and obviously, I am as stated above, but I don't want her to feel bad (although probably unavoidable).

Can my employer force me into a promotion I don't want?,28,7va0m2,"Hi,

I am a Redditor, but this is a throwaway for personal reasons.

A little backstory: I've worked for the same very large US company for a long, long time.  Too long.  I've been promoted a couple of times along the way, and I've been generally happy with the advancement.  I'm a 42 year old guy that still doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life.  I do strive to like my job, and that was the case for years but has since taken a turn in the last 3 or 4.  

The position I was at a decade ago with this company was great for me in my 20s.  The pay was fine - nothing crazy, $50k annually -  but the work/life balance was great.  It enabled me to start my own consulting company that I ran for a decade.  I eventually stopped burning the candle at both ends in an effort to save my health, and concentrated solely on my day job since my company ran its course. (I wasn't happy anymore, so I closed.)

I'm a guy that prefers to enjoy his life and to work as little as possible.  I'm sure if I found something that I truly enjoyed I would spend many hours doing it, but I'm not that same romantic person anymore.  I'm older, have a family that I love spending time with & my wife does really well financially.  I don't necessarily have to work, but I want to.  I'm not lazy, I just have some options.  Working my ass off for peanuts is not a hobby of mine anymore.

Being with the company almost 2 decades, I have a true understanding of the business.  I know the systems inside and out, coworkers respect me and I respect them and their work, and I'm well-liked.  I've fixed problems, I've created problems that I've had to fix.  I still work there simply because the pay is still decent, the work-life balance is excellent, and it's close to both of my kids schools.  My wife works a job where she can't leave at the drop of the hat to get them, yet I can.  With that said, I hate my job.  I don't dread getting up and starting the day, but I hate walking into the building.  I hate the smell.  I hate the look.  I'm immediately disgusted, and look at the clock every hour.  When someone says ""holy cow it's 3:30 already"", I think to myself ""Yessssss...2 more hours to go.

Local leadership there is horrible.  Senior leadership is half clueless, and simply is focused on unreasonable metrics that we're barely meeting as a branch.

**At any rate, here is my question:**  Recently, the Manager of my department transferred because she moved.  The Supervisor of the department recently quit because he could not take the local leadership any longer; the threats, the condescending attitude, the inability to recognize issues and simply force blame, etc.  

Because I have been there so long and because they have literally no one else, they are trying to push me into this position.  I don't want it because what will happen is my pay will go up 5%, but my responsibilities will go up 10 fold, and my hours will go from a strict 8 to a flexible 14.  

In no way, shape, or form am I interested in that.  I have a dollar figure in mind that I want to do the position, but it's astronomical and laughable.  But it is what I want if they are desperate enough, and if they want to pay me what I want, sure I'll do it and I'll be the best person they ever had in that position, and we'll meet and exceed goals.  I'll admit I can be bought, but I will do it on my terms.  With that said, they'll never pay me what I'm asking because what I am asking means I'll make more than the person I'd report to.

So what do I do?  The basic answer is I should have looked for a new job 10 years ago.  I'm sympathetic to that criticism.  Trust me, I get it.  I got very comfortable here, work with a lot of great people, and was never hurting to make that next dollar.  So in that sense, yes I got lazy.  The issue is, I have no idea what other job to look for right now.  I haven't gone on an interview in 20 years, and starting that process again is terrifying to me.  It shouldn't be, but it is.  I'm just trying to be honest with my feelings.

Can they force me to take this position?  I've been approached 4 times in 12 months now to take the position, each time they give me more urgency and each time I say I'm not interested.  I don't want to go out like this, but I also don't want to be forced into a job that I'll have to resign from within a month because I can't take the hours or the attitude.

Opinions, ideas, questions, suggestions...all are welcome.

Thank you.

"How can I find a job I do not hate, that still has reasonable benefits, pay and growth opportunity?",32,6o84jo,"I am almost 30, and my ""like"" for my previous jobs range from ""I like some people here but the work is meh, to this job sucks, to, i hate every day i wake up and go to my job"".  
  
I have a good career path, while I am not specialized and a bit ""late"" for others my age, I have a master degree and some years experience in a couple fields. I am somewhat underpaid (I accepted an extension for 2 more years of my current job because I knew I wouldnt like any other job I could find in the next months anymore than I like this one).  
  
Whats crazy is that, this is the best job I have had, and while slightly underpaid, the benefits are pretty nuts, I share a big office with 1 other person, and sometimes an intern (if I need help with boring tasks I can sometimes get an intern to do it), I get over 40 days off a year (paid), full health, all this bla bla, my boss sucks balls more than any office boss I have had (retail boss from my younger days is a different category IMO).  
  
Anyway, I do these career finding tools, and think about my interests when I was starting education, and it always points to IT related fields... there is no way in hell I am starting another degree to start over, I just dont have the patience or time for this, and despite my large amounts of time off, i have no free time due to a serious illness in my family, which wont change in the next year or so.  
  
I feel like I am an ungrateful idiot, who complains about being underpaid by probably just a few hundred a month, despite the amazing benefits, and such... but the work is bullshit especially with the boss, and every job I have ever had in a proffesinal environment, has gone from ""hmm new and slightly interesting"" to after a few months ""this is boring"" to ""i fucking hate this shit"". It is literally why I went and did a master (in something i am only vaguely interested in) because I couldnt stand my job anymore, and a master at least was a productive way to just do part time consulting for a while....  
  
I feel like I have the working mentality of a hippy who just wants a chill job with no stress, but I can't live with the idea to have a dead end job that is even more boring than my consulting job now. I also have no interest in a more challenging position because my energy for work and life is just being totally drained as time goes on.  
  
How do people motivate themselves to care about any job? Even a ""dream job"" say, video game tester since I like to play games, turns to bullshit when you actually do it, because playing the same stupid shit over and over with different combinations and trying to find weird bugs and whatever the fuck is going to be shit pretty quick.  
  
Basically i feel that I am the realization of the steryotype against my generation of being lazy and entitled... really I want to find a job that has critical thinking, but that actually pays me decently, and that leaves a work life balance, but doesnt drain my life/soul at an exponential rate every day I go to work. Due to some bullshit from my boss, the last week I have had an excessive amount of time to finish a project and just sat on reddit for a day and a half straight because I already finished everything needed (still have several more days... i gave up asking other managers and shit for stuff to do because they literally have either nothing to do, or stuff that is basically just for interns)....",2017-07-19 15:28:27
24yo student who just cannot decide on a career path - any guidance on how?,29,b4fw49,"\[Posted in r/findapath but I figured I'd also post it in a related subreddit.\] 

I'll try \[edit: I tried\] to keep this brief - I'm not exactly a unique case.

Basically i'm a 24yo male who's feeling completely lost in life.

I graduated high school with no focused passion, ended up completing a commerce degree majoring in marketing mainly because I couldn't stomach the other avenues of business, worked in corporate for a year and found that fairly soul crushing, did a brief teaching qualification which I didn't hate though didn't really enjoy either, and have now returned to uni and am completing a bridging course into physiotherapy - an area that I might have somewhat of an interest in. In truth I'm not sure I'm cut out for this line of work either.

The issue is I've never had particularly strong passions, or cultivated much of an interest in anything which could feasibly become a career path. I love obscure music - thought about studying it - then discovered that 2 coworkers at the retail place I was working at had music degrees from the university I was considering going to. Plus I want to keep that passion compartmentalized from work lest I lose it.

Unfortunately it seems that we live in a society where those without firm resolutions are generally tossed about and left in the dust of those with a more competitive and tenacious mindset.

I'll often blame my apathy on my diagnosed depression and ADHD (both of which i've tried medicating and therapy to no avail), but regardless of the causes, that's the hand I was given, and I'm struggling to figure out how best to play it.

I was in an academic talent program throughout high-school, and that did wonders for my indolence by instilling a mindset that I'm naturally intelligent and shouldn't have to work as hard as others to achieve the same ends - which as I've discovered is a load of horseshit. I've watched naturally 'less intelligent' individuals from school surpass me on the back of hard-work and dedication, and I can't complain, in fact I think it's only fair.

I've read self-help literature, done the cold shower deal, no Fap, listened to motivational podcasts, etc. I've tried to hearken the adage 'Nothing worth having was achieved without effort', but I still feel trapped in a nihilistic spiral. Whether I'm actually nihilistic or whether It's just a coping mechanism I use to justify my lack of effort and subsequent failures I'm not sure.

I definitely struggle with self-loathing, often feeling like a special snowflake porcelain horse apathetic weakling who needs to sit down, shut up, stop avoiding commitment and responsibility, and force themselves to work hard like most of the world does. Nobody loves chores and hard work - they're just innevitabilities.

Being a 6'4 'intelligent' white male living in a 1st world country with supportive family already creates some tacit expectations, and only exacerbates the negativity when I realize how ungrateful I am and how much potential i'm squandering.

Basically I want more zeal in my life. I don't want anything enough, and never have. I need the spark that causes you to jump out of bed when the alarm goes off in the morning, and not stare at the clock all through work/university so I can get home and continue marking time.

Perhaps I'm searching for something that doesn't exist? I think I just overthink things too. Maybe just doing things before I can justify a reason not to would help.

Anyway I'm not sure what else is left to say.

Sorry for the pitiful rant, but if you can or ever could relate to my situation, if you can suggest any ways I can uncover a passion or help me determine a direction, or if you have any general advice or strategies I would love to hear them.",2019-03-23 09:22:00
Need some resume/interview help? Here's some things that should help you out.,29,apz0mc,"I see a lot of the following way too much. As soon as I see something that appears to be bullshit, it's an absolute red-flag and chances are I'll throw away your resume.

* If you owned a small business, you're a business-owner. You're not an ""entrepreneur."" It's okay to switch back and forth, but I want to know that you're at least capable of working within the confines of a larger company.

* You're an entrepreneur if you built a business and sold it, or if you founded a business, raised money, and grew the business. But if this is true then there's not really a reason to be applying for a job.

* I'd rather see failures *and* what you learned, than nothing at all. Everyone makes mistakes, not everyone learns from them.

* You likely weren't a CEO. A CEO is given that job title by a board of directors. If you were a business owner, then put ""business owner.""

* Be very clear about sales goals, targets, expectations, etc. If I see something like ""I led a team that produced $2 Million in sales"" that doesn't tell me a lot. What if your sales goal was $10 Million and you didn't hit it? Probably why you're looking for a new job.

* Know your industry! Do research and due diligence! Know what the top 10-25 companies are in any given business area. Read the news about them. Know what types of projects they have coming up. Read all of their recent investor reports. The more research you do here, the more it will show me that you're really interested in working for this company.

* Be *willing* to learn. If you apply to a job, and don't get it, don't apply again in 6-months having learned nothing about the company. Tell me what you've been up to in the past few months. 

* I'm not impressed that your resume is 4+ pages. I've seen resumes that were *10 pages*. Tailor your resume for the specific job that you're applying to. It should be 1-page. I also only keep about 5-years of work experience on my resume. Anything before that is probably out of date. And if a recruiter/interviewer asks about it, that's the time to fill them in.

* Make sure your resume is formatted well, and use some advanced formatting techniques (this shows me that you know how to use MS Word). If there's an inch (or more) of white-space around the edges, and the character spacing spreads the words out, and if you have a large font, it means you're making up for lack of experience with bullshit techniques. I'd rather half a page filled in the top and *nothing* in the bottom half, than a full-page resume in 16-font.

* It's okay to say ""No"" if you don't know a question I ask. That's why I'm asking, to gauge whether or not you're a better candidate. Maybe you only gave 3 No's, but the other candidate gave 6. Don't ramble on if I ask you a yes or no question. Either you did the work or you didn't.

* ALWAYS ask if there are any concerns the interviewer has before the interview is over. This is your last chance to tell them anything else that factors into their decision.

That's a good start. If you do these, you should be in much better shape :)",2019-02-13 00:11:22
Can I start applying to jobs even if I don't have my degree yet or do I have to wait until I graduate? (aprox. 6 months),31,ajsape,"Okay, so I don't know if this is a stupid question or not but here's my situation.

Very Interested In Renewable Energy. What's The Quickest Path To Employment? [Illinois],29,a0ue7k,"Renewables are something I care about and I believe I could find a lot of meaning and satisfaction by contributing to that industry.

I like working with my hands, so I think being a technician/installer is a good place to start my job research.

- Are there trade schools/unions that would provide paid training?

Second Thoughts on a Marketing Career?,29,9r5rdt,"I've almost finished my second to last semester as a marketing undergraduate. In the time I've found what I love is strategy and innovating ideas, however what I've drastically underestimated is my loathe for an office job. Recently I've been working for a consulting firm one day per week as a ""Digital Marketing Intern"". 

I sort of hate it? I dread coming in every week. I was dishes for a living an enjoy my time in the kitchen more (lesser of two evils situation)

I think I want to have a career outside of the office but my entire life has been built for this role, I always thought I wanted this but now I don't even have the motivation, if this is what life exists for. 

I'd like to be outside, around nature. Building personal connections, talking and engaging but I understand their are tradeoffs. Has anybody else backflipped on their undergrad degree's?

How to deal with a co-worker who is around 55 years old that thinks everyone wants to diminish his work?,32,8yqrsu,"So I work as a programmer in an office where I seat beside a person who feels like that almost every day, in fact, I see two main problems that affect the rest of the team.

- I feel like he is super worried about being older and be left behind the others

- if someone completes a task faster than him or figures out something he couldn't, then he thinks that person is trying to show herself better than him.

- This person is also the kind of person who imagines things in his mind and I find that dangerous, I always try to be careful

- I feel like every time I have an achievement and everyone gives me compliments, this person feels like his work is being diminished, and no one gives him compliments (he already told many times me that another person on the team trying to diminish his work and I told him that was not true but anyway...)

- is extremely negative and complains about everything when is doing a tough task, everything is frustrating and speak negative things out loud and it affects me in a negative way, I'm working beside someone who is a black hole of negative energy and I've never been in a situation like that in my 7years of experience D: 

- I already thought about talking to my manager, but I have no idea on how to talk about that to my manager because these are pure personal things but it affects my work with all that negativity, we work in the same team on the same projects.

My concerns are:

- Bringing personal stuff to my manager could be a bad thing? I've never had this kind of conversation with a manager, and what can a manager do in situations like that?

- This person also makes a lot of noise and complains a lot speaking out loud in the office, talking to me complaining a lot about the job when facing a tough task (enough to make someone wishes to say ""SHUT UP DON'T YOU REALIZE YOU'RE BEHAVIOR IS TOXIC"", this always brings me negative energy, I'm super positive and I try to help the person but the person seems to be helpless

I feel sick of all these things, it really causes a bad impact on my work routine and I'm looking for a way out.


Important Note:

- I'm not the kind of person who gives away, I try to help build his confidence by giving compliments when is 1-on-1 conversations, in meetings, internal chat but it doesn't seem to work as it's something internal",2018-07-14 07:40:11
Struggling with giving up on dream. Anyone have similar experience?,30,8vy2m6,"First time poster here!

I have been having a really hard time this past month. To start off with a bit of background -- I am a 23F recent BHSc graduate in Ontario. My WHOLE life has been a journey focused on becoming a veterinarian. Since elementary/high school, I have meticulously planned out every aspect of my life to lead me to vet med. Worked in a vet clinic for almost 7 years while in hs & uni, achieved stellar marks, volunteered etc. It goes without saying that I LOVE animals and I love what I've seen of medicine. Basically, I have always been a high achiever and perfectionist. Anyone that knows vet med knows just how competitive it is. Unfortunately, I have failed to gain admission to vet school for the past two cycles. It is extremely hard to accept and I have found myself in quite a severe depression, to the point of wishing I wasn't alive (but I'm honestly not suicidal). I just feel like such a failure, and I feel so embarrassed to have failed at my lifelong dream. I'm angry for focusing so much of my life on this goal, and having nothing come of it. All of the years of studying, volunteering, being the  grunt in a vet hospital -- all to be told that I'm not good enough. I have been in the top 200 applicants for both years, which is promising, but it is just so competitive that obviously admissions are down to a matter of splitting hairs. There is only one vet school in the province. Due to stupid residency requirements, Canadians can only apply to the school in their province.

Basically, I am at a crossroads. I could keep applying (Im allowed to apply 2 more times). My issue is that I am now struggling with the idea of continuing to put my life on hold for this evasive career path which may still reject me. Since I have put so much into it, Ive had complete tunnel vision and haven't dated at all and I know that if I continue this way I will not date and will probably end up alone for this career. When I realize this, I'm terrified. Yes, this career is all I have ever wanted. But I have also always wanted to meet someone and eventually have a family. I am trying to teach myself that there is more to life than being a vet, and if I were to succeed and become a vet but not have a family/be alone, would it be worth it? 

I really just want to be happy, but in pursuing this dream it has only made me unhappy and feel like a complete failure/loser. I want to move on with life and forgive myself for not being good enough. Being a perfectionist, this feels next to impossible. 

I'm thinking of pursuing teaching. Obviously not my dream, but maybe doing something different is what I need. If I were to do this, I could be finished school at 25 and have a career. If I continue to focus on vet, I will likely not be settled until 29/30. 

I am also extremely angry at myself for putting all of my eggs into the vet basket. I wish that I had opened my options more in university (ie simultaneously worked towards other careers such as human med). I have such a strong interest in medicine and science, and I know that technically it's never too late, but I'm just so tired. Tired of trying to be perfect, trying to get the best marks, get the best experience --- and having all of this lead nowhere. All I feel is constant disgust towards myself. I'm sick of hating myself for failing. I just don't know how to move on from these feelings and thoughts. It doesn't help that l compare myself to others (ie. friends & aquaintences from university who got into vet school, family & relatives around my age who are in some sort of prestigious career path). I always have thoughts of ""I should be like her"" or ""I'm so fucking inferior to her..she must think I'm an idiot"". Deep down I know that I'm intelligent, likeable and kind. I'm constantly being told by others basically how great I am. But all I see is a failure with nothing to offer.

I don't even know what I really want out of this post lol. I'm just so unhappy and confused.

Is there anyone out there who gave up on a dream of becoming a vet?? Or any career for that matter. Any advice or insight? Clearly, I overthink a little too much.

If anyone actually read this, thank you. I really appreciate it.

Would you take a 60% pay cut to get out of a toxic and poisonous work environment?,30,8pq7it,"Basically my supervisor is out to get me. He has been charging me with one infraction after another.

Is it worth going to school at 30 when I already have an established career in IT?,30,8mr6pv,"So to start my story, I'm 30 years old and I never completed my university degree.

I went to a top university from 19-22 for a degree in Software Engineering. I dropped out (really stupid I know) after struggling really hard because I was just too anxious/stressed at the time to deal. As weird/ridiculous as this probably sounds, no one actually knows I dropped out, my parents and friends and everyone else in my life actually thinks I have a degree, because I went back to my school town and just worked menial jobs during the last couple of years people thought I was finishing my degree.

I got an entry level job at a start up IT company the year after I had supposedly graduated from uni, starting at 37k salary. I got the interview and was vouched for by a family friend, so I guess they just didn't do a background check. I've always been good with computers anyways, so I was able to pick up this job easily, and within a year I was promoted to a Business Analyst. And now 7 years later, I am a Senior Business Analyst at 86k salary, doing fairly well in my job (getting recognition awards at my company, pretty much go to person for scoping out big projects).

I was wondering at this point, is it worth going back to get a university degree at all, or am I well established enough with enough experience that it shouldn't really matter at this point? 

Would it be more worth it to look into getting some sort of certifications instead, that could help push my career forward?

Sorry if this all sounds ridiculous, I just want to keep moving forward in my career and my lack of university degree does still haunt me on some days, so I just wanted to get some opinions from other professionals out there.

Thank you!",2018-05-28 19:09:47
My cognitive abilities have been declining due to many years of unrestorative sleep. Can you suggest a new job or career path that pays reasonably well?,31,85km79,"I’m looking for ideas for a possible job with the highest pay that requires a minimal amount of critical thinking and manual labor. I know, I know…I realize that this is a stretch, but hear me out.

I’m 49 years old and have been working as a graphic designer, mostly freelance, for about 18 years. Before that, I was a fine artist and usually paid the bills working as an art handler for the occasional museum and gallery.

Recently, my cognitive abilities have starting to decline due to 16+ years of idiopathic hypersomnia. This means that every day I wake up feeling as if I haven’t slept at all. I’ve been to tons of doctors and no one knows why I can't get restorative sleep. It sucks and has pretty much ruined my life. The cumulative effect that this has had on my brain and body has been profound. It’s affected my concentration, ability to remember things, reading comprehension, ability to learn new skills, etc. My brain is in a constant fog. My ability to do my job as a designer has been greatly impacted. I’m much much slower now and it’s become difficult for me to solve the kind of problems which are a normal part of my duties as a designer. This has resulted in a tremendous amount of stress, as well as mistakes being made, deadlines being missed, etc.

So, it feels like I need to find something new. Something that will be less stressful and that puts less demand on the creative and intellectual part of my brain. Something potentially where my duties would be fairly straightforward. But I have no idea what that would be.

In addition to my cognitive impairments, my body feels stiff and tired all the time. I try to exercise but nothing seems to help. So, it’s hard to imagine doing something that requires a lot of physical effort for the majority of the job.

I went to fairly selective schools for college and grad school, so I’m still smarter than the average bear. I always saw myself as being an intellectual person, so you can imagine that this has been pretty difficult for me.

Also, I’m an introvert. So, I’m probably looking for something that doesn’t involve interacting with the public the majority of the time.

I bought a condo a few years ago, and would like to be able to pay my mortgage and, at least somewhat, continue to live the lifestyle that I’ve become accustomed to.

Any job/career suggestions?

TL;DR Cognitive decline has affected my abilities as a graphic designer. Please help me find a new career that’s less stressful and taxing on me!",2018-03-19 19:07:38

"Too many interests, feel like I'll be missing out on something no matter what I do. How did you come to realize what you wanted to do?",30,6zbcf1,"All my life, I've been super interested in a lot of subjects and have bounced back and forth between job ideas. Now, they all do have some similarities; I've always thought in the STEM field. I've had a passion for science as long as I can remember. The problem is, I'm now a community college student (long story, was accepted into several unis including Chapel Hill, chose an engineering school, attended orientation and everything but father lost his job and we got no financial aid), and now that I'm finally on the path to becoming something, I'm starting to second guess everything. Thus, I've been questioning all of my career goals and paths recently. 

When I was really young I wanted to be a marine biologist. That was my passion, and to this day, I have a love of all animals, specifically fish. However, as I grew up I realized that while I would love the career, I want to do something with my life that actually helps people. So, I considered things such as biomedical engineering and biotechnology. Then, however, I discovered environmental science, and for a couple years I loved it; it combined my passion for nature with helping. But then I realized most environmental jobs are just policy advising and stuff like that. I considered engineering for a while; what better way to help than to solve the world's problems? Apparently, though, most engineering jobs are tedious cubicle jobs that engineers hate. Considered medical doctor for a while because I'm fascinated with the human body and have already taken some health science classes, but I'm not too sure if I want to do postgraduate education because I'm horrified of the concept of debt, as another huge thing is I want to travel. I considered computer science; my father does it, my brother is learning it, why don't I do something? The main problem with that is that it would lead to my worst nightmare of becoming a desk jockey sitting in a cubicle all day doing the same thing over and over. 

So you see, whatever I think of to do, there's a reason to do something else, or a reason not to do it. I feel like whatever I do with my life, I'll regret that I never did something else I wanted to do. If I become a sysadmin, I'll never be a marine biologist. If I become a physicist, I'll never be an environmental engineer. Right now, I'm just in my first semester of a community college associate's in engineering transfer program, but I'm thinking of changing my degree to either nursing transfer or computer science. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post, I have a lot on my mind and don't really know how to word all of it or what to include. Onto the question. How did all of you decide on what you wanted to do with your lives? Was there a magical moment that everything just made sense to you? Thank you for any insight. I need to find my shit out as soon as possible so I can pursue the proper degree and hopefully live a fulfilling life.",2017-09-11 01:23:59

"I have a couple months experience as a laser operator, but my trainer makes the work miserable, should I stick it out or leave? And if I leave what can I use this limited experience towards?",27,bvklgn," A year ago I started at a job at a metal company in their fulfillment  center. A job where I loaded, unloaded and cut small orders of metal,  nothing fancy but with good pay. Originally I hated it it but during the  tour of the facility I saw their laser cutting department and decided  early on that I was going to do my best to try to get to work on the  lasers. After 5 months, I was moved to a department that allowed me to  learn all the sheet metal in the warehouse since the fulfillment job was  all tubes, rectangles etc. After 3 months of working there I reached my  goal and got promoted to laser. I really enjoy the challenge that comes  with learning the programming and what does and doesn’t work, and have  started teaching myself python (just for fun) as a result. But there are a lot of  issues in my current position, without going into too much detail my  “trainer” said day one he didn’t want to train me and has done his best  to “help me fail”.  I went from really happy to miserable in the span of  the last few months.

So where do I go from here? College is not an option, I was  17 credits away from a bachelors of science in poli sci when my life got  derailed and I had to drop my classes late, therefore owing more money  than I can possibly afford to my former college, which means I can’t get  financial aid to finish up somewhere else. I’ve looked at some coding  websites to see if I can teach myself to code online but from what I  understand even if I learn it, I won’t have a degree to back it up and  won’t get hired anywhere. I went from liking my job well enough to  everyday being a struggle to get out of bed because I dread showing up  to work.

I was there for three years. It was very stressful the first two years but my supervisor and his supervisor were great and able to keep things in tack better for a bit but then they both left at the same time. Things got completely out of control after that.

&#x200B;

What do I say when asked my reason for leaving without bashing my former employer? Especially in regards to why I left without having another job in place. I know it was probably a mistake to leave but I really broke mentally and hindsight is 20/20.",2019-02-26 18:03:13
"Should I accept an offer from Company A that uses an older web technology and pays well, or should I wait to finish the interview process with Company B that pays the same as Company A but uses the latest technology, knowing full well that Company A’s offer might not hang around?",27,9ruz5r,"Should I accept an offer from Company A that uses an older web technology and pays well, or should I wait to finish the interview process with Company B that pays the same as Company A but uses the latest technology, knowing full well that Company A’s offer might not hang around? 

Hi, I’m a Web Software developer and need some advice. I currently have an offer from a company with an amazing pay but it would be a step back in the technology I’d be working with. They have plans in the future to modernize their system, but it’s not on the near horizon. At the same time I’m in the middle of the interview process with another company that may pay the same (or more) with the latest technology.

My scenario is this, I need to respond to the offer by Wednesday which is 2 days before my interview with the other company. I don’t want to accept the job and then turn around and say “I got another offer” because that may look bad. I also don’t want to decline the offer and then NOT get the second offer and then be back at square 1. Some advice on this would be great

Note: if I accept the company that gave me the offer, it would more likely be a short term move (2 years or so) which would allow my wife to stay home for a year when we have a child (not pregnant yet) and it would allow me to get out of debt a lot faster as well. So there’s some big pluses there, just would feel like I’m behind on how fast web technology is moving.

UPDATE: thanks for everyone’s advice. I ended up being called by Company A’s CTO to discuss with me their future plans in technology, they’re working on some cool stuff in the next 2-5 years so I feel better about taking that role. At the same time I was honest with him regarding my current status with Company B and he was completely understanding and was willing to wait for me to find out about that first before giving them an answer",2018-10-27 18:13:40

Can anyone help me figure out a career path? (Mid 40s),29,8gkrks,"So, as the title says, I'm in my mid 40s, and I've been floating around in some form of either customer service or tech support for the better part of 20 years. I attempted college three times in my early to mid 20s, and really didn't have my shit together -- the upshot is that I'm defaulted on student loans (only about $8-10k, but still hard to chip away at).

I like what I'm doing now (official title is Product Quality Analyst -- but it's more of a combination of high-end technical support with an eye towards root causes and data gathering and looking at other tech support cases to determine whatever information Engineering and Product Quality Project Managers are looking for). I like working with computers, and I like finding out what causes issues and using my analytical skills -- but I'm also fairly decent with people.

I'm leaning towards trying to get a Linux certification and moving into Linux administration -- because it would tick most of the boxes and also pays more than I'm making right now (currently low 40s, would honestly prefer 55-75 -- I don't want to be rich, just 'comfortable'. My definition of 'comfortable' is 'If something happens, I got it covered, as opposed to ""Oh shit, now what do I do?""

Is this a good idea -- or is there something I'm not even thinking about that might be better? I did take a career assessment (free, of course) on 123test.com, which gave me a Holland code of IRSCEA.

Again, I'm not unhappy in my current role -- but there's not a lot of upward mobility where I""m currently at, and the one thing that really -does- stress me is the pay.

If you've got advice, I'd really appreciate it, and thank you to everyone reading.",2018-05-02 23:49:21
What is a reasonable expectation for number of hours to work a week in a salaried office job?,31,8cckcf,"I realize this varies by profession.  I'm an accountant (not a CPA), senior level (basically means I have over 5 years of experience but I'm not managing anyone).  

I started a new job in January and almost everyone there works 60 hours a week, meaning long hours at the office and then working from home on their laptop evenings and/or weekends.  

In my 10+ years as an accountant, I've *never* encountered this before and I was appalled.  These people seemed to think it was ok (we're all salaried).  

I got so stressed out and fed up (there were other issues in addition to the hours) that I decided to quit after only 3 months.  This makes me feel like an absolute loser until I remind myself that I am the 7th accountant in my department of about 16 to quit since January.  

Anyway, is the 40 hour work week dead?  My new job that I'll be starting soon has set hours, though I'll still be salaried, 9-6 M-F.  So 40 hours plus 5 hours for lunches.  Totally fine with that.  Also fine with working more during the busy times of the month, but only when absolutely necessary.

I'm 40 years old, if that matters.  I just don't understand why some people just roll over and work more than 40 hours a week for no overtime pay.  I value my free time so much, and I work to live, not the other way around.

Am I lazy, or realistic, or idealistic, or what?",2018-04-15 06:03:07
Feeling Stuck. How can I get out of this funk at work and push for a raise? (Upper Management w/o Raise for 5 years.),29,8azx5l,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text, I will start with the facts;

1) I have been at my current employer for 15 years. 2) This company is a construction company with 300 or so employees (most of which are field staff) 3) The last 6 years I have been in an upper management position, running a specific service offering. 4) This service offering I brought to the company, grew it from it's infancy to $7,000,000 in gross revenue in 2017. 5) I am responsible for the hiring, firing, training, estimating, business development, and operations for this specific service offering. 5) I have not received a raise in 5 years. (Currently at $82,000 with some additional incentives that equate to probably more like $95,000) 6) I have not received an incentive bonus in 3 years. (The one I did receive was halved due to ""the company not being in a strong position""

Long story short, I have been with a company for 15 years. I have not received a raise or a bonus (which is promised in writing / tracked but with a ""company health"" loophole,) for 5 years. I birthed this service offering and grew it to $7,000,000 in gross revenue this past year (doubling every year in the past 5 basically.)

I am responsible for literally everything that has to do with this service offering and it's weighing on me heavily. I am not usually a ""kudos"" or ""attaboy"" type, but not being shown appreciation in the form of money is really starting to hurt my mental state in regards to my work.

I have gone to both the owner and the operations manager (my direct report) about getting a raise. My direct reports response is ""I haven't gotten a raise either."", and the owner's response is the same that it has been for 10 years. Basically that if everyone keeps doing everything right, everyone is going to be set for life.

The problem is that I have heard this rhetoric for a really long time, and all it does is just piss me off more now. To the point where I am disengaged from my work and my team (There are 14 people under me.), things are falling through the cracks and it's becoming a mess.

Second issue; I have a ""Do Not Compete"". So if I leave, I have to leave the industry for 2 years and will have to take a significant drop in pay.

Help me navigate this issue please!",2018-04-09 19:48:38

"How can I, another directionless college student with a ""useless degree,"" find a fulfilling career?",29,7pi1ha,"I'm graduating next year with a degree in English with great grades from a mid-tier university. I've finished three internships and have been apart of my college newspaper for all three years. Two I took because I couldn't find anything else, and they do not relate at all to fields I'm interested in. The most prestigious and relevant internship was in journalism, which is something I've been working on since Freshman year of high school.

My skills

-Good writer/editor

-Good reader (analytical)

-Reporting skills

-I'm good at school

Things that are holding me back

Social anxiety

Lack of ambition, no passion

Lack of confidence

Sense of being lost

You may ask, why not do something in journalism? I don't think I'm cut out for it due to my social anxiety. For example, during my internship I had to call a PR rep from the government, and I was super, super stressed just about this minor call. I couldn't think during it, which led to a bad interview. Essentially, while I have the writing skills, my personality doesn't suit itself to journalism. Not to mention that it's not exactly the most stable, lucrative career right now.

Career ideas I have...

Teaching (college or HS) -- The idea and stability sounds nice, but I'm not sure I'd actually enjoy it. I do love being a student and the academic environment. And becoming a professor is incredibly difficult.

Law -- I have good grades...I can make good money...??

Copy editor -- Not that many jobs here...not sure how I even get my foot in the door since I can't find any internships in this field.

Publishing -- I like books, but I don't really know what this type of job even entails...?

Librarian -- Idk...maybe?

Anyway, you get the point. I have no idea what to do, I feel like I only excel at schoolwork (not ""real work""), and the career I've been preparing for doesn't seem right for me.

"How to un-f*ck my [27F] ""career""?",30,7dbh1x,"I graduated undergrad with a B.S. in bio a few years back and have been meandering between jobs/careers for the past 5 years. My lack of finding the right fit combined with a lack of commitment on my part to any one job/field/career choice for the past 5 years is really starting to drive me insane.

I've worked as a teacher, retail sales, solar sales, waitress/bartender, personal assistant, admin assistant, you name it.
Interestingly, the waitress/bartender gigs are most enjoyable (time goes by fast & quick $$), but am sick and tired of the world (e.g. my mildly elitist family, friends who make serious bank in the tech industry, etc) undermining me for choosing to be in the service industry. It really affects my self-esteem. 
I am now job-hunting for ""good"" to ""better"" jobs but I don't feel qualified for 95% of them that would make me look good/ make me feel better/pay me a better salary.
This insane path of non-commitment/lostness all stems deeply from the fact that my entire life I was (still am) so passionate about the environment. I chose to pursue conservation biology in higher education so I could save the world. Something happened during undergrad where I just came away from it all extremely uninspired and highly pessimistic.
I'm still pessimistic, and have serious doubt about the direction of the world, but I've really just got to get on with things.
This is my first ever post on Reddit. If you've gotten this far in my post thank you for hearing me rant. I just want to find stability in my life and a good career. Any and all suggestions highly welcome.

Edit: I just want to add that in my younger years I entertained the idea of becoming a research scientist without understanding what it entailed. I've got brains but I'm not necessarily the brainy type. Many of my colleagues from my department in college went onto getting their masters in research, PhD, and medical school but I just don't see those paths for myself. I just genuinely found evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation to be fascinating as well as it being my passion. 

I've just got other pursuits as well; namely interacting with people, and the arts, as well as fashion and visual design (such a drastically different field that I was never able to explore). My deepest darkest secret is that maybe I need to go back to school but for something completely different, either digital visual design and/or the textiles and fashion industry, and am bummed I need to go back to school all over again.

What $45-50k desk jobs are available for someone with no particular qualifications?,28,4q637s,"I currently ""manage operations"" for a small Amazon resale business. I make 44k plus a very good health plan. I stumbled into this job through personal connections. I don't like it, I'm not great at it, and the company is very unstable. It's basically unprofitable and will cease to exist when the owner stops throwing money at it - I've brought up the issues many times and we have no solutions.

I'm studying web development in my free time and should be ready to look for work in that field in the next year or two. In the meantime, I'm terrified this company will collapse and I'll wind up waiting tables and being unable to pay the bills. I need to develop an escape plan. Possibly I'd like to leave now if I can find a position that's a better fit and less stressful.

**My ideal position:**


- $45-50k. I think I'm making close to 50 now considering benefits. I could go as low as 40 before I'd have financial trouble and attendant stress.

- Desk work, moderate physical tasks ok.

- 40 hours, not a lot of pressure to work more hours.

- Structure! I'd like people to learn from and processes to follow. Right now I'm basically running a small business alone, coming up with all the answers myself, and it doesn't agree with me.

- Work required, rather than solutions. I don't want my job or the wellbeing of the company to be dependent on my ability to continually find and press through solutions to make a business plan workable, or to struggle for profit in an increasingly competitive market. If I were insane enough to want to do that, I would take out a loan and start my own business.

**My current position, skills, and resume points:**


- BA in Linguistics (If I had one bullet for every baby boomer that said ""just get any degree!""...)

- 7 Years of experience in loading docks and warehouses, supervising for 1 year at current position;

- Management/Supervision of 3 employees;

- Managed operations during growth in annual revenues from less than $1m to $4m;

- Oversaw movement to, setup of, and organization of new facility;

- Built, maintained, and utilized spreadsheet-based solutions to handle a number of problems including: Employee productivity, Shipping and receiving merchandise, Tracking on-site inventory, Tracking merchandise stats and profitability on a per-item basis, building and placing orders with suppliers;

- Drew up and placed merchandise orders using data-driven methodology (also developed the methodology and helped define the operating parameters);

- Trained employees to follow operational processes, and designed said processes;

- Know some HTML, CSS, JS, Python, decent with IT troubleshooting/software/etc, enough to be useful but not enough to apply for a job requiring those skills


Now. This can be spun into a workable operations resume, and I can talk it up in an interview. However, I hate operations. Thus, my qualifications are pointless.

I **especially hate** the prospect of supervising low wage workers. I'd like to exclude that responsibility, if possible.

I want a quiet job where I produce certain output, have well-defined and reasonably scoped responsibilities, and am not really expected to have an active hand in the viability of the business or business model. And I want that job to pay $45-50k, on the eastern seaboard (currently Northern VA.)

What categories of job might fit my requirements? Is this possible with my current skills? Maybe it's asking a lot, though it's around the median individual income for my demographic and educational level.

"Am I dealing with distorted career expectations, from others?",30,b4wbpa,"Edit: Tl;dr: A lot of people have told me I am a superstar. I don't know if I will regret not fulfilling their expectations.

I am 38, and I never really made anything of myself.

I grew up on a farm, but went to university and earned a bachelor of arts in history. My friends were like me: smart slackers who half-assed their way through.

I kind of pissed away my twenties, then went back to the family farm at the age of 29. We were starting our own winery, and I really had something to prove at this point.

During this time I went flat out. I was a young entrepreneur and I played the part, working all hours, etc. My wife and I had two kids during this time.

And. . . it didn't work out. The winery was not a commercial success. We had to sell. I was 34 and without a real career and unemployed. I had never turned my bachelor's into anything so I figured I'd start over. I did _not_ want to go work for the competition.

I went back to school (community college) for electronics engineering, but this time I was a killer. I graduated at the top of my class (which I did _not_ expect) and got a lot of feedback that I was very talented.

I got a cool, but temporary, applied research job developing robotics for viticulture. It's not a real job - it's meant for students and recent grads. I became head of the robotics team.

I met the Federal Minister of Science, who told me I was going to change the world.  

One of my former profs told me he expected me to revolutionize viticulture, and that he expected to read about me in the Globe and Mail.

I was invited to speak at a precision agriculture conference. I was on the cover of a local magazine because of my work.

Plenty of people have told me that they expect me to start a robotics company. My boss thinks I should get a master's degree. 

I don't know if all this has been healthy for me. My house needs new eavestroughs and I cannot pay for them. If I got some an ordinary technical job I could work my way up and do just fine.

But now I have all this noise in my head that I should shoot the moon. And I want to - but I'm not sure if this desire is genuine or what. I don't know if I would regret an ordinary career path or not, any more.

"Feeling so lost careerwise, how do I restart?",29,ayziys,"I feel like my life is a mess right now so be forewarned, this may be a long read (sorry).

So for the past 2 years and 9 months I have been working as a deli associate at a grocery store, overall it's one of the best jobs I've had but it's also not exactly full time or pay the best....i get at least 32 hrs a week and I've had benefits with the company for the past year and a half. We've had a new deli manager for the past month and she is not exactly the best for the role, she pushes off work on everyone and everyone is miserable and I have been overworked....working 6 or more days a week for the past month, and it's getting really frustrating because lately they've been cutting my hours and I'm getting 39 hours but they spread it over 6 days. 

So I have been motivated to find a legit full time job that I can actually make a living off of. Thought I found a great job that pays 14.50 an hour....I went and did the tour and the drug screen, they later called me and asked when I could start and I told them I want to give my current employer two weeks notice and they said it was fine, that was just last week. Fast forward a week later and they call me and let me know that they don't have any open positions but they will let me know if anything comes along. So now I have to go to my current employer asap and tell them that I didn't get the job after all and I will not be leaving after next week. This job that I applied to seems to be one of these huge corporate places like amazon - who I've also tried to work for - that hires ppl in large numbers and has a huge turnover rate. I'm assuming that during my two week notice they must've hired too many ppl and didn't have room for me but I feel it's so ridiculous that they set a start date with me and allowed me to notify my current employer only to screw me in the end and tell me there's no longer a job for me but whatever, that's how modern day corporate America works. 

But, trying to keep it short, I feel like I've spent the past 7 years being lost careerwise. My last job before the deli was working as a clerk for a fuel office. It was also low pay ($10/hr) and I was always chosen to be laid off in the summer. Before that I worked at Amazon, which I hinted at earlier is a place that is extremely difficult to make rate. Before that I was scheduling freight deliveries at a trucking company, was also low pay at $11/hr and it was high stress having to continuously deal with missed and late deliveries for our clients...i got chewed out multiple times on a daily basis for loads that I had no control over. I couldn't stand it so I fled to Amazon just to get out. Before the trucking company I worked at express scripts as a data entry tech, it was an ok job but it was a burn out job and management was always up your butt about quotas and your job was never secure even though we were union. And I'm glad I left express scripts because they eventually shut down that location. Before that I had a temp job at the state and before that I was in college studying web development but when I got out I fell victim to the typical conundrum of ppl my age who don't have the work experience to break into their field.

I'm at the point where I feel absolutely hopeless and I have no idea what I want or need to do. I just turned 31 and I feel like I am so old...too old to not have a career solidified let alone not have the slightest clue as to what I'm doing. I also live in a very small town area where there are no decent jobs(most employers around here are factory jobs with a high turnover) and everything is an hour away. I just feel so isolated and screwed. 

Just feels like whatever calling I had in life I missed it and now I'm floating in job limbo, where every job I take is some menial low paying job that takes me nowhere in life. Sometimes I think, what if I took another crack at college and did online courses but I have no idea what id even do and I'm so afraid id fall into the same old trap of getting into debt and ending up empty handed career wise. 

So I have no idea what to do, have no motivation anymore after failing so many times. I don't know if venting on here is actually going to help but it just feels good to vent and it's always comforting to meet people in the same boat or who were in the same boat. So please, if anyone has ever been in the same situatuon....please tell me it gets better, I really feel like I can't take anymore disappointment or b.s.

Is there a career field that is both practical and creative?,30,9rz07a,"As a student finishing at a 2 year university and transferring to a 4 year, I'm at a crossroads in regards to what to major in and what career field to pursue. While I'm getting an Associate's in Political Science, I'm planning on switching to either Advertising or Finance upon transferring. I like Advertising because of the creative aspects, but I'm worried that what I learn as an ad major would be so unique to that one particular industry and I wouldn't have any transferrable skills or knowledge should I need to work outside of the ad industry. On the other hand,  with a finance major, I'll obtain skills and knowledge that can be translated to any industry, but I doubt there would be room for any kind of creative thinking. Is there a career field/major where I can learn practical, transferrable business skills as well as have a creative outlet, or do I have some misconceptions of Advertising and finance and need to do more research?",2018-10-28 03:00:33
What kind of career allow me to travel a lot and work in different industries ?,28,9o1ttf,"A friend of mine is a business consultant in a major company and he's always working on different types of industries every month.

After being laid-off from a stressful job I find myself at a crossroads. Anyone have similar experiences or advice?,28,9hhvor,"So this will be kind of long as I feel some details are important.

&#x200B;

I went to school and received a MA degree in Media Psychology. My passion/motivation has always been to develop the groundwork and change our understanding of how narrative impacts audiences. In basic terms, I theorize that it's possible to quantify  (to a certain degree) the emotional engagement/impact of a narrative. Understanding this would give us the ability to more surgically adjust narratives to better emotionally engage audiences. This theory could be applied to any story-driven medium. However, this is all just theory and very little research (that is publicly available anyway) exists on the topic. So one of my driving passions has been to build this groundwork. This is a very long-term ""life's work"" kind of deal. 

&#x200B;

In pursuit of this, few years ago I moved across the country to try and make my way into the consumer insights industry. My hope was that this would eventually afford me the opportunity to work in entertainment, specifically game development/publishing. The reason I wanted to go into gaming was that not only do I just enjoy games themselves, but games are actually a great medium to test  my theories on a large scale product. For example: you could test gender, age, and racial influences on mission completion (i.e.: users are more likely to complete missions if the quest giver is younger or older than themselves). 

However, I've come to realize that these companies rarely do this sort of work, at least in-house and those who do are very competitive. Up until recently, I have been working in consumer insights for a vendor where I was I unfortunately laid-off 2 months ago due to a mixture of financial and performance reasons (both my team and department directors are acting as references and trying to help me find a new job). That said, I've been actively applying to everything I can find, but haven't made a lot of progress. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm not sure I even want another position like that. At least not on the vendor-side. I was constantly under a lot of pressure and broke-down more than once in the months leading up to my departure. Furthermore, my experience didn't seem to give the advantages I wanted to get into the entertainment/gaming industries. Furthermore still, as I mentioned earlier, I seemed to have overestimated how much consumer insights research goes on at these companies. Often times, ""research"" at these companies refers to either tracking ratings or UI/UX testing. These are things my previous employer didn't work with making it difficult for me to translate my experience into applications now. 

&#x200B;

So here's where the crossroads comes in:

1) I can stay the course and keep trying to find another insights position. This is probably the best option for the immediate future, but long-term I don't see it fulfilling my goals as I'd hoped originally. I had planned to do some of this research on my own-time, but that hasn't been sustainable as my work-life balance was already rough. 

2) I can try to go into academia. I currently have an MA and know nothing about how to get into higher-education that would allow me to research (though I have people I can ask). While this is a massive career change, the reason it comes to mind is two-fold. A) It potentially allows me the opportunities to research my field. B) I went back to my undergraduate school and gave a talk about working in corporate research and life after college and it was one of the most full-filling experiences I've had. Not to say that being a professor is just giving talks, but it opened my eyes to the possibility. 

3) Something else I've considered, which kind of confounds everything else, is whether or not I want to do this research of do I just want to work in game development? This research, this theory, has been the driving force of my life for the past 7 years. Maybe it's a lack of confidence after being laid-off and the performance stress I felt during my time at my last employer, but I'm not sure if my dream and I are compatible... If that makes sense. Something I'm just starting to dabble in is 3-D animation. The thought of working in cinematics has been interesting me for awhile and from the little research I've done indicates that self-taught doesn't matter as long as your portfolio is good.  However, I'm nowhere near applying for a position in this field as I've just started learning the basics in Blender. This is just something I'm putting on the  table. 

&#x200B;

In the end, no matter what I decide, I need to get a new job immediately and insights is the best option. I just wanted some external input/perspective. 

Thank you for reading!

Would I [24f] be too old to consider enrolling in medical school?,30,9etthm,"The only experience I've ever had in healthcare was being a lifeguard when I was 17 and also volunteering at my local township Emergency Services Department as a certified EMT. I've also graduated with a B.S. in Health Sciences from a state university. I'm currently going through an externship as a medical assistant in order to hopefully get my foot in the door working in a hospital. I have absolutely no connections with anyone in the healthcare field, which is why I unfortunately have no choice but to start from the very bottom (entry level position), regardless of my background education. I'm 24 years old, and still want to continue my education, perhaps even pursue a Master's or doctoral degree. However, I still don't know what I specifically want to focus on in the medical field regarding my own career path, which is why I think my best bet is to start off in an entry level position before investing any more of my time and money into school. I really want to know what position I would enjoy learning about and advancing in first. Being that I'm 24, would it be too late to even think about medical school once I figure it out? Let's say I want to become a surgeon. Am I being a little unrealistic here?

Is an Amazon At-Home job safe?,26,99sgtx,"Hello, I was recently referred by a family member to look into a position at Amazon.

Is such a position ""safe"" (In that I'm not going to be experiencing something out of a job-related horror story)? Can anyone attest to an at-home Amazon job? Just looking to get a bit of research done on the subject in a general sense (As there are several positions available via work-at-home).

"As a teacher, what jobs will my skill set transfer to in order to make better money?",28,99ibuh,"Hey gang,

I've been teaching for three years and I'm tired of being totally broke all the time. I love the interpersonal relationships I can build with my students, but there's just no money in it. I've got a wife and baby who need me to spend my time earning real money without the drain of a classroom and the extra time I work for free on the side.

I have a BS in Psychology, with my teaching license that I earned through 2 additional years of college but, sadly, no additional degree.

Before teaching, I was a police dispatcher for 4.5 years for a large agency, managing up to 15 police officers and field supervisors.

I directed police and emergency response to a variety of high pressure situations while maintaining extreme levels of accuracy and safety.

Excellent interpersonal communications and relationships.

Skilled writer (Have been published numerous times in small press and magazines, etc.)

Can someone help me so that I don’t call it quits by the time I’m 30?,28,9598lo,"Jokes aside, I need some serious advice career wise. Let me give you the good bad and ugly.

I’m 23 years old, in the process of still earning my diploma . (Family tragedies caused me to drop out, and currently working 50 hours a week doesn’t leave me with time to attend night school. But that has changed.)

I have been working full time as a barista for 6 years, and I can’t do it anymore. I have supervising experience but I’m making cents above minimum wage, no money to save. 

I’m filled with existential dread when thinking about my future, and the mere possibility of ever having a family or a job I love.  I have never gone to college, and I have no idea what I want to do. At all.

And the process of watching all of my friends leave college after 4+ years and having no job in their field, terrifies me. 

Every time a career sounds good, I look into it and I find it has low hire rates. The outlook is bad. The schools are expensive.

I’m lost. 

Since I’m not passionate about anything (clearly) what are some career choices that require little/cheap school, offer decent pay, and have a positive career outlook? I know that is incredibly broad, but I have an open mind.

Tldr: I’m very uneducated and want to start getting educated. Career suggestions and positive vibes so I don’t call it quits.

Art majors who didn’t pursue a career in art: what did you do instead and how did you make it happen?,29,8sbxvl,"First, a little about me... I graduated with an art history degree in December 2017. I’m about to turn 25, directionless as ever, and haven’t had any luck with the job hunt.

I currently have a graphic design internship, but honestly my self-taught design skills are nowhere near good enough to be competitive. I could take design courses to get better, but after working this internship I’ve decided design isn’t the career for me. Designers are too often overworked, underpaid, and under-appreciated from what I can tell. I don’t want to put the time, money, and energy into becoming a designer just to be dissatisfied.

I think a big part of the problem is that I just don’t know which types of jobs to look for or who is willing to hire me.

So where can I go from here? What jobs should I look for and who will hire me? If you were also an art major, what did you end up doing, and how did you make it work? Thanks",2018-06-19 22:58:22

5 Resume Tips to Land More Job Interviews,29,1wanxo,"Your resume might be so impressive, so precise, and so perfectly aligned with employer needs that your readers take one glance and hire you on the spot. This scenario is not at all impossible—in fact, stranger things have happened in the job-search. But it’s rare nonetheless. And most successful resumes don’t lead directly to job offers—they lead to phone calls and interview invitations.

So as you draft and edit your resume, you can consider this your primary goal. It’s your resume’s job to pique your reader’s curiosity, get her attention, and convince her to meet with you in person. It takes only two minutes to pick up the phone and make an appointment, and once you convince her to make this easy move, you’re halfway home. So how can your resume accomplish this mission? Start by keeping the following tips in mind. 

1. Don’t worry about one missing credential. 

Or two, or even three. If the job post asks for a master’s degree and you only have a bachelors, or if the post demands five years of experience and you only have three, don’t let this stop you from applying. And don’t draw attention to this minor detail in your resume or your cover letter. If this deficit truly is a problem or a serious deal-breaker, let the employers worry about it. And let them decide when and how to bring it up.

2. If you have what these employers are looking for, make this clear. 

State, don’t suggest. Leave no mistake in anyone’s mind. Use the exact wording used in the post, if possible. For example, if these employers need someone who “can work nights and weekends as necessary” or who is “CPR-certified,” use these exact words in your resume summary and cover letter. Not only will this help you get past keyword searches, it can also help reassure a reviewer (or recruiter, or HR pro) who didn’t write the post but is acting on behalf of the person who did. 

3. Offer something no other candidate can. 

This can be a credential, a specific experience from your past, or a personality trait. But make sure it’s something these managers will appreciate, and something that not everyone in the candidate pool will be able to claim.

4. Stand out.

Take a risk. If you have to choose, err on the side of standing out rather than fitting in. Strategically break a few resume “rules.” Explain how your imperfections, your mistakes, and your quirks give you an edge over your competitors.

5. Identify a problem, and then explain how you intend to solve it. 

This may require a little research. But if you can show that you understand a specific problem your employers face, and then explain how you—and only you—are uniquely poised to solve that problem and move the company forward, you’ll inspire your readers to give you a chance.

One Chance Is All You Need

If you can just get one foot in the door—in this case, the door of your interviewer’s office—then you can let your voice, your true skills, your presentation, and your charming personality take over. But in order to take that first step, you’ll need a strong resume. And you’ll need to introduce your resume with a memorable, beautifully formatted cover letter.

"My job rescinded a full time remote offer after I disclosed I would be relocating for my husband's job, and now they know I'm leaving in the near-ish future and have been treating me differently. How can I stay motivated?",26,bxx4n9,"Super long - TLDR @ bottom.

My husband is finishing his PhD and will be  starting a job at the end of the summer requiring us to relocate. I have a great job that, although frustrating, is very fulfilling (and pays very well, shockingly). I spent a lot of time pulling together a robust remote work proposal, incorporating communication schedules, accountability measures and new technology our company rolled out to facilitate remote work. A pretty good number of people work remotely across my company, and my supervisor was 100% on board, however, he isn't the final decision maker. His supervisor, the division director,  gets the ultimate say. She is 100% technology illiterate, has been at the company for over 25 years and is VERY old school. If it isn't her way it isn't right. she micromanages and believes that remote work doesn't facilitate ""collaboration,"" but what she really means is she thinks people won't work if they have a remote job. I wasn't going to give this presentation to the decision makers until my husband had an offer and we knew where we were going, but my direct supervisor essentially forced me into it. I have gotten a raise every year and am consistently acknowledged for my work by the CEO and leadership across the company. I'm not trying to brag, but I've really made a place for myself here and people value me.

&#x200B;

All this being said, my supervisor gave me the good news that I would be allowed to work remotely on ""soft funding."" Long story short, I write and execute a lot of grants, so my salary is often supplemented with external industry funding, as are my coworkers'. The idea is even if I'm not 100% funded, my coworkers'  salaries who are ""hard funded"" and have ""soft funding"" supplementing their salary would offset the difference in my soft funding. This is pretty common in my industry. He then came back and said, just kidding, you can work the percentage you're funded, so part time. I made it very clear that I would not do any work outside of my funding deliverables if that was the case because there are some serious boundary issues here. 

&#x200B;

I haven't told them my decision for several reasons, but mainly because if I move to California (which is very possible), the company won't incorporate there and I won't be able to work remotely anyway. We are in limbo as my husband finishes his program and interviews across the country. My other coworker gave her two weeks, and frankly my company will be f'd if we both leave because we're the only two with any institutional knowledge (it is a strange environment, I could go on for ages). My status hasn't changed, but micromanaging division director has gotten way up in my shit which I do not handle well. On top of this, I'm feeling very undervalued and frustrated because I'm not worth the risk of seeing how remote work would work out for even a trial period, they feel like they're making me a good offer which was actually very offensive, and my boss was talking about a promotion, title change and more management opportunities even after he broke the bad news. I'm so confused about where I stand and I'm so frustrated, because if I were in a different division it wouldn't even be an issue. I'm having a very difficult time staying motivated and have been noticeably short with my boss and division director. I have plenty of references, and I know I shouldn't burn bridges, but I am not a happy go lucky fake it til you make it kind of person, and I want them to know how I feel. 

&#x200B;

My husband and I decided that I would quit and offer to come back as a contractor after we move and get settled the same day as his start date. We want to take some time to travel and spend time together before he starts his first job. We've saved enough to make this happen, even if my job says no. 

&#x200B;

How can I make it the next couple of months (2 max)? Any advice? How can I leave gracefully while also kind of giving them a big FU? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: My employer knows I will be leaving in the near future, offered full time remote, then rescinded. I'm frustrated and salty and feel undervalued and unmotivated.

I do still live with my father because I'd rather not just hand over my whole check for a seperate place to stay just yet. I have a reliable car because how do you expect to make money if you can't make it to work?

One main issue is that I can't justify going to college for something I'm not invested in. I've witnessed too many acquaintances and friends alike just throwing thousands of dollars away by changing majors like they were nothing. Cannot afford to make that kind of mistake. 

Originally I wanted to go into ASL. However, I just became more and more worrided about learning a new language as I had a tough time in HS Spanish class. Then I was thinking ""S.T.E.M field.. Or radiology? Respiratory therapy? Maybe I should go into like HR.. Everyone needs HR!""

I feel like I'm on a train platform. I am on my own here, lost, and I don't know who to turn to for assistance. I still as everyone around me is going by at a brisk walk, so sure of their destination, with heads down and no second glance. Unfocused eyes and whirling thoughts in every face. When I do grab somebodys attention, they ask where I'm headed or where I would like to go. Still I have no answer but ""Up. ..Higher than this.."" 

How do I build a future for myself when I cannot even decide where to begin? I've got $1,000 in savings (emergency fund I guess) and food on the table, but I'm better than that! I want more. I need direction.

As I see it, I am too poor to be able to go to school full time (unless I just pile all of my bills onto credit cards and take out massive loans??) But I make too much to get assistance with college. 

And IF I can decide what path to choose, what happens if it flops? What if I can't repay all my debt??

Accepting any and all advice. Thank you to those who took the time to read my shitty post. I am mashing my head into a wall at this point. I graduated HS 4 years ago... It's time to get this figured out. I'm so scared.

When did you realise you were undervalued by your boss/employer?,27,bwdw5l,"Today, after working so diligently and proactively for a team/boss who made me believe I was valued I was tossed into another team without any say. He also let me know that the work I was doing was not something he considered to be part of the team’s longer term vision (despite saying otherwise). Given the fact I am quite jr this will definitely shape how I invest my time at work. Never again will I give 100% into anything at work. Never.

I've been volunteering out of the country for over four years. I'm looking to return but really have no idea where to start.​ How should I handle re-entry?,27,bpjzum," 

I'm from the US but I've been volunteering in Mexico for the last 4 and a half years. When I left I basically got rid of everything that I had and came with only the things I needed that could be fit within a pair of duffel bags. I'd return with essentially the same, except now I've gained a wife. A majority of the people that I knew where I'm from have kind of scattered all over the country now, so I really have no 'home base'. (Not that I'd I want to return there anyway...) The ministry I work for provides all the essentials for living that I need here, food, housing, etc. This keeps the cost of living extremely low, and I can survive on the very basic financial support I receive from my donors in the US. I've been able to work with a lot of different people from this community and all around the world, and I would not trade this time I've experienced here for anything.

I'm 28 and my passion is in video production, editing, and creative writing. I get to stretch those muscles fairly frequently in my current position, but it does not receive my full time focus like I hope it someday will. I work as guest relations with short term missions teams, coordinating them with assignments, long form tours, etc. Before I left the states, I only had experience in retail, which was soul sucking, and I vowed never to go into that again. I went to a tech school and got a certificate in Digital Media Marketing. Though I have had my toes dipped in that realm here, producing dozens of videos and content for the ministry, I'm unsure if I can claim it as 'professional' as these have all been done in addition to my 'main' work and obviously volunteered using my own minimal equipment. I've spent the last week pumping up my LinkedIn, but my 'network' seems lacking as it's likely I'm not using that resource to the best of its ability.

Now to the meat of the post: The gears are starting to turn for what coming back to the States would look like. The issue being that I don't really have any kind of huge savings built up to live off of. Basically, I guess for my own comfort, I would prefer to have a job before I move. Also, the earliest we would be able to relocate would be at the end of the summer. My wife and I have been looking for employment / apartments in the Orlando / Kissimmee area, as we do have an interest in that location and some connections there but none with the ability to put us up for a while. My main questions are:

**Do you guys have any advice about what my first goals should be as far as re-entry with very little saved up?**

**Should I start applying for jobs today, even though I can't start for at least another 3-4 months?**

**Is my background helpful in any way as far as applying for a future in these fields when I technically have no 'professional' experience in them? Or is it smarter to bite the bullet and find something less up my alley?**

Any other insight you may have would be greatly appreciated. The prospect of a change is exciting, but the 'getting there' part is giving me a little anxiety, and if those feelings are unnecessary, i'd rather enter this new chapter in the best way possible.",2019-05-17 02:50:50

"Just dismissed, age 25. I keep losing jobs due to similar reasons about attention to detail and communication. What should I do?",28,allu3e,"Hi, I was just dismissed from my job after working there for eight months.I am a hard-worker, have a good attitude and get along well with others but I do poorly at the actual work involved in most jobs I've had. I was mediocre as a teacher, a tree-planter, an administrative assistant, a busboy, a barista and as a warehouse hand. I haven't had work that hasn't fit into one of those categories, essentially and am 25. Even so, I wonder whether I can do any job well. I did well in school, but I put twice as much effort in as other people and the expectations are easier there, so I feel that this doesn't really mean much.

I feel discouraged. At this recent job I got dismissed because through trying to be helpful, I was overstepping the boundaries of my role, thereby getting in trouble. Well, I also had attention to detail problems, which I have always had and can't seem to change though working slowly and carefully helps. I could be better with communication, with decision making and with relying on my own info and knowledge (though knowledge retention is a problem for me). 

I feel stuck, because I am not sure what career paths I could do that do not involve these areas where I am weak. I feel lost. 

Should I try to intentionally work on these areas or should I focus on my strengths? 

Should I pursue work that does not involve them as much (like what?).

24F - Feeling frustrated with Biology degree and need some ideas?,27,9sz1gs,"I graduated with a double major in biology and psychology with the (semi-serious) intention of attending medical school. Long story short - I applied for two cycles in a row, but I half-assed the process. You have to understand that it is a bit uncharacteristic for me as I’m generally the ambitious type (GPA 4.0, numerous awards, disciplined). But whatever reason, it just couldn’t get myself to commit fully to the process. It was a bit of cold feet. I think it’s a lot of fear - chiefly fear of mental health issues being exacerbated, loneliness, not being good enough, and not having time for family, etc. (I never dated nor been in a relationship, barely have friends. I don’t want to spend the next decade with those patterns perpetuating.) I do value work-life balance. I also realized that I’ve been on the path partly because of some degree societal pressure and intellectual insecurity. But I do want to help people.

I currently as a lab technician at biomedical lab, which isn’t fulfilling me at all. I realized that I’m not into research despite having 5+ years of experience. I’m burnt out so I will quit soon.

Anyways, there is a small part of me that wants to disengage with the healthcare profession and pursue something else. Partly because my social anxiety is awful, though I am a bit better with one-on-one interactions.

So I’m pretty lost and frustrated and stressing out so much. I want to figure things out as soon as possible. I hate spinning my wheels. Anyways, here some possible career ideas I’ve drafted:

1. **Clinical psychologist (PhD or PsyD)**: Originally wanted to be this when I was younger. I am fascinated by the mind and human behavior. Friends and family say that they see me in this role quite naturally. I would still need some more research experience to even be competitive, so it could 1-3 years for that come to fruition. Right now, I’m truly, absolutely burnt out with academia and research right now. I’m not necessarily opposed to more schooling, but I vacillate between getting a job right away (3-5 years) or spending more time in school.
2. **User Experience (UX):** This would be the biggest risk for me as I have no experience in the tech world. But UX definitely caught my eye and I am so so fascinated by user principles and user research/human cognition. I just started learning HTML/CSS. I am kind of enjoying it. It is also the biggest deviation from my comfort zone of academia and sciences, but I feel I could be good at it (empathy and analyzing is a strength) and it offers me some advancement. I just don’t know where to start! I am think maybe front-end developing.
3. **Physician Assistant (PA)**: Work-life balance is the biggest draw, here. Decent compensation. I am currently shadowing now. While I do like the profession, people are constantly telling that I am wasting my potential here. I don’t think that’s the case to be honest. I still get to contribute to people well-being in a meaningful way, but I wonder one day, I will wake up wanting more as there is a bit of a glass-ceiling.
4. **Dentistry/Optometry:** Would be a burden to take DAT/OAT. I do like the fact that they are shorter than medical school as they generally lack residences. For dentistry, the debt is a factor and I don’t know how saturated the field is. I’m very good at working with my hands. Optometry - haven’t researched as much.

Feel free to throw some other ideas!

I don't know what I'm posting this for, but, I also know I need insight, advice, and overall any thoughts and positive vibes in any way at this point. I don't even know what job I actually want, I'm not lazy, I work hard, every job I have had in the past can reference how often I worked more than most. So I know it's not that. I don't even know where to really start with this problem I'm facing. Should I share my most recent fall-through 2 days ago? I'll include that I guess. Do I explain what problems I have currently? I'll update as this goes, I guess. I honestly don't know where to start at this point.  I want to get into a career at this point in my life.

I've tried welding, didn't work out... I wasn't able to pass TIG... I recently (2 days ago) drove up to North Carolina for this promising venture into climbing cell towers, didn't work out. The owner of the company's nephew was a nightmare, harassed/tried bullying me/left me on my first climb for 3 hours alone while they went off to eat lunch. We had words, I didn't agree with him, so I drove another 7 hours that day after my first day on the job to get back home and quit. That's the shortest version of a more elaborate nightmare, but this is not the place... but yeah that fell through fast.

The past 5 years have been a fuck-all of odd jobs and retail work, seasonal work.

"35 years old, how do I go about resetting my career?",28,9goif4,"I'm 35, MBA grad with roughly 10 years' work experience and working in a big Telecommunications company as a Marketing Manager (more of an internal consulting role focused on ""improving customer experience"", but only in a way that reduces our costs or increases our revenue, and with no good reporting in place to help us show the impact of ideas on said metrics). 

Something clicked in me around February and I've been increasingly hating my job, both in terms of what I do on a day to day basis, the company's decision making and focus on short-term profits over long term success, and working at a large corporation where getting anything done is dependent on 10 other people and very challenging/frustrating. Looking back I hate the entire direction my career has taken since getting my MBA. I went from non-profits to banking to telco...I would love to go back to non-profits, feel like I'm doing something that has a positive impact on people's lives.  Lastly, I don't feel like I add tangible value or know how to do a particular thing really well - the bulk of my job lies in trying to convince people to do things that they are under-resourced for. 

I would quit if I could afford it, but there is the reality of it being incredibly difficult to find a good job these days, especially if I'm going to be picky about the type of job I want (and realistically, unsure of what exactly I want). I feel like my experience and specialization don't really fit well in most non-profits, so making a lateral move would be very challenging (other Marketing areas useful to non-profits, like sales or communications, I don't have much experience in, I also haven't had people management experience, which I would love to have an opportunity to do but has never come up). I'm fine with taking a paycut, starting fresh, learning a new business and working my way up again...but I'm worried that my resume would get overlooked as being 'overqualified'. Considering 'downgrading' my qualifications, titles, and experiences so I more closely match requirements of jobs...how unethical is this?

Looking for any advice I can get...is this an early mid-life crisis? I feel trapped. 10 years isn't even a third into a career, right? Please tell me it's not too late.",2018-09-18 00:29:46
Should getting a raise/bonus after layoffs have me concerned about company future?,28,9e4gtl,"I work for a large organization undergoing radical business changes and recently went through a large layoff with more “restructuring” to follow and headlines of potential bankruptcy. In the midst of this, I fortunately was spared for layoffs but recently received a sizeable raise and bonus unexpectedly (half now, half in six months) - basically a retention bonus though that verbiage was not used.

Should this have me concerned about the outlook of the company? I was previously shopping lightly for a new more stable employer, but the raise/bonus makes me think I would be safe for a while. Has this ever backfired or is this a warning sign of other company issues ahead? I don’t want to be blindsided like a lot of my coworkers were, but it would be nice to enjoy the added benefits provided that another employer likely could not match.

I am job searching and my struggle is coming up with the right answers when asked to explain my last job in depth. So far I have been saying:

\- I moved on from the job because I felt I was not getting enough support. 

\- I tried to reach out, but more support was (understandably) given to more revenue-generating areas of the department.

\- I am looking for more open communication, feedback, to be able to make an impact, and grow into my next role.

"Husband has been subcontracting for 18 months and in spite of zero experience has received an offer for a management position significantly less than regional/national average. Should he accept, negotiate, or keep trying to find subcontracting work?",25,8t9tnv,"Update #2: They countered my husband's counter offer with slightly less salary but agreed to 2 weeks vacation right away and after 6 months, he will be eligible for the 3rd week. Thank you all for your advice!

Update: Husband is more than likely taking the job anyway he can get it because it's management experience and taking it has much less impact on us financially if we picked up and moved across state or country. That being said, using statistics from US Bureau of Labor and anecdotal references of salary and benefits for colleagues and friends in similar positions and field, he countered with $10K more (just slightly above 10th percentile median for title and region) and 3 weeks vacation. I'll update with an outcome as soon as possible. Thank you all for your input!!

We live in an economically challenged and depressed region (upper Great Lakes). Husband graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering technology and through his long time employer, eventually gained an accredited Masters degree in Operations Management for which his company paid but then didn't put to use.

Husband left company just before his 10 year mark for a career change Project Manager position from which he was ""downsized"" 6 months later. After 4 months of unemployment, his long time employer reached out to him with a contract offer to which he jumped at because the pay was $55/hour with full time hours. I work full time and carry the insurance for our family so it was ideal.

1 month ago, the company opted not to renew his contract but has kept him on a smaller project to project basis. All the while he's been looking for full time, permanent career path work. He was offered an engineering manager position with a very small ""local"" company despite not having any management experience. This job is about 40 minutes away. 
Salary offered was $65,000 per year which is significantly below average and median. He has been working professionally since 2006. They also offered only 1 week vacation when he was at 3 weeks vacation at his last permanent job.

The hiring recruiter at my job lied to me and now I'm stuck in this new position with less pay for a year. How should I tackle this situation?,26,8dfc5b,"I worked part time at a decently large bank at a call center, primarily in sales. I was pretty good at it, getting more than even some full time reps. I tried to move to other departments in the same company but got rejected because I didn't have enough experience. There was another position I was trying to get but they hadn't responded in months because of internal disorganization after I interviewed with them. 

I was offered a position as a business banking rep full time. The recruiter told me that this would provide great experience to get into higher sales roles in the company. I have friends and coworkers who moved up in the company no problem so I had no reason to be skeptical. But the lie was that the incentive would be uncapped. 

Not only does the incentive have a cap, but it's pathetically low. To put it in perspective, the max sales incentive is capped at 300 dollars monthly if I hit a certain sales threshold. But in my previous sales role, hitting my max goal for part time, which I hit pretty much every month, I received 500 dollars sales incentive (before tax). I would have easily doubled that if I went full time. 

So essentially, in this new position, I'll be making at least 700 dollars less per month. And I can't move out of this department for a year. That's how every department works. You have to stay there for a year. I only took the position because, based on the conversation with the recruiter, I would have the opportunity to at least make as much as I would have made as a full time sales person. I was willing to make a lateral move for more experience and to pad my resume, but a downward move is upsetting me and I know it's currently effecting my work while I'm in training. 

What should I do? Should I bring this up to my supervisor despite being rather confident that it won't actually change anything or should I suck it up? I'm heavily considering leaving the company but I'm relatively comfortable and am afraid of going to another company with similar problems. I enjoy banking so I'd stay in that field. I just want to be compensated for my excellence and my current role and this company isn't doing that to my satisfaction. Especially given the very harsh cap on my incentives which I will be able to hit without even trying, putting me in the same position as the guy from Office space, for at least a year.

What full time career to pursue that doesn't need a degree?,26,89j5v6,"Hello everyone.

I have been working in retail as part time sales associate for almost two years. Prior to that food service as a cashier (lots of cash handling and selling experience but it gets boring quickly)

My current skills: Adobe Creative Suite, cash handling, some brief volunteering working in an office setting, organizing paperwork and sending emails for office meetings, and basic knowledge of print layout. I also minored in world history so I enjoyed conducting research and writing analytical papers.

$35 an hour perm or $55 an hour contract?,26,821r5x,"I am 30 living in Boston. I started working at 16. $5.35/hr in Virginia. I’ve worked my way into systems analysis and recently—after 7 months of unemployment and a lot of soul searching and personal growth—I found a Business Analysis position paying $70k salary (edited for spelling). Please excuse the numbers. I want to avoid vanity, yet I don’t think speaking mysteriously in terms of percent-increases is a clear enough picture. 

The position is with a healthcare company’s IT department. Their HR took three weeks to finally send me a request for background check. Something about them getting bought out by another company, and my offer not being approved in “the system”. 

I kept hunting.

Have an opportunity (not yet an offer) which would pay $55/hr for a 9 month contract. No benefits (not from recruiter either) no vacation days of course. 55 is a big step up from 35 in terms of dollars—but what about the job security and benefits that come with the perm position? 

What would you do? Caveat: I don’t want to be a BA/BSA for much longer. I have loved unemployment. I like the idea of finishing a 9 month contract with a company (a college in Boston—cool!) and then taking stock with hopefully racks on racks on racks in the bank. It’s been a long time coming for me to learn fiscal responsibility. I’m ready to grow up. Quit weed quit alc quit nicotine for weeks now.

My mental illness was reported on the news. I'm in college. How do I get an internship?,26,7mtgfr,"Hi,

I'm a college student who wrote a suicide note a couple years ago. It got reported on the news and went all over Google. My school freaked out and asked me to stay in the hospital for a week, which I did, but I later realized this would disqualify me from lots of professions (aviation, medicine, high-level security clearances, etc.) It was a difficult time and my grades dropped after that...I even got an honor code violation. I came out of it feeling like I'd fucked up my life at 19. (Not trying to break the sob story rule, but I think this is all relevant information because it's publicly available.)

I'm still here in school but things have never been the same. In high school I used to be successful, ambitious, and motivated but now I don't realistically see a future for myself outside of endless explanations and struggling to survive. 

I was in business school but after all this happened I started to worry that Wall Street wouldn't accept me. I didn't get an internship and after that decided to switch into liberal arts (economics/philosophy) to try for grad school. I don't even know what I'd do in grad school, however, because I can't go to law school (due to the violation) or medical school.

I'm sort of lost...I feel like I'm just bad news. I don't even know what I want to do because I find myself asking, instead, what they'll allow me to do. I'd be happy: interning at an investment bank, working in real estate, working in consulting, being a professor, being a journalist, being a lawyer, or doing economic research. However, I applied to a lot of internships this fall and didn't get anything. I still want a summer internship if I can get one, but I don't know if it's a lost cause. 

How do I make myself marketable?",2017-12-29 11:56:02
"People with IT security jobs, what do you do, how do you like it, and how did you get there?",28,7ejgx5,"I am looking into an IT security certificate/associates degree program at my local community college. I don’t have a background in IT (this is a change in careers for me). I have lots of questions. I already contacted the college with some questions but I’d also like to hear from people in the field. 

Can I really get a good job offer without a 4 year degree? The careers listed on the college website are all $60,000 annual or more. I’m finding it hard to believe I can get work like that with a 12 month certificate. 

What was your education like?

How do you like the field? Does the work get monotonous?

What does your week look like? Do you work a lot of mandatory overtime? How is the work/life balance?

I already have a BA in psychology and was working in human services. The work was very stressful. I was on call 24/7 and I was unhappy with the work I was doing. I’m looking for a job where I am responsible for myself (no more managerial roles for a while), and can maintain a good life/work balance. I’m hoping to enter a career path where I can support myself and a family one day soon. ",2017-11-21 19:24:26
What the fuck am I doing wrong?,28,780u5o,"I haven't had fulltime employment since November of last year. I have spent that entire time doing freelance and part-time work.

I have sent what feels like thousands of applications. I have looked up every tip and watched every video. I send personalized cover letters and keep my resume updated. I do everything I'm told to do. 

Only a handful of responses in that entire year, leading to unanimous rejection across the board. I've applied to multiple industries, positions I was underqualified for. I've done literally everything job-related you can imagine.

Why am I so goddamn stupid? My own family have begun telling me that it must be my fault that I'm being rejected so often.

Why am I the most unemployable human being on earth? ",2017-10-22 18:30:28

"I have no degree, no money, and only service industry experience, but I hate the service industry. What can I do for a living instead?",27,6s231p,"I'm 27, I have no degree and no money. I've been a cashier, a waitress, a retail sales associate, and I've worked in fast food. I hated all of it, and it didn't pay enough to live on. I need a job that pays enough that I could live by myself and pay all my own bills if I needed to.

What I didn't like about service jobs is having to put on a fake personality and be nice and subservient to strangers all day, even when they're rude to me. It actually was pretty bad for my self esteem, and I'm still recovering from that. However, I am a people person. I've always gotten along with coworkers, and I know how to be professional.

So, I know what kind of job I don't like, but I don't know what kind of job I could do. My only requirements are that I don't have to deal with customers directly, and that it makes enough money to live on. I have no money for college, so I will have to learn some marketable skills some other way.

I know ""learn to code"" is common advice on reddit, but where do you start, and what kind of job can that lead to? I know html, and I'm willing to learn some coding languages, if it will get me a good job.

I'm good at public speaking, and have given speeches in front of groups before. My hobbies are crafts and gardening. I'm ""good with my hands,"" whatever that means, so if there's a trade that's very cheap to learn and doesn't require a lot of physical strength, I'm willing to try that. I just don't know where to start. I'm not looking to find my passion or anything, just a job I don't hate, that makes a living.

Thanks for reading this, and feel free to ask any questions that might help you help me. I know this isn't much to go on but I appreciate any advice y'all might have :)",2017-08-07 03:26:48
Is it always a bad idea to accept a counter offer from your current employer?,25,6lmvue,"I've read a lot of posts/comments here and in PF that when you receive another job offer, never accept a counter offer from your current employer.  I've been at my current position for over 3 years and performed very well in the last year, which was confirmed by my manager at my annual review in April when I received the top rating.  I expected to be promoted (which comes with a fixed increase in salary plus is necessary for future career progression/promotions), but my manager  told me on two occasions when I pressed him that he expected a promotion would be coming to me soon but the timeline for that is out of his hands.  I believe him- I have a very good relationship with my manager, and from our conversations I know he wants this for me.  It seems the approval for the promotion is stuck in upper management or HR.  Something I've learned from others in the company is that whether or not a 'candidate for promotion' is an immediate risk to leave the company plays a big part in the upper management discussion for giving out promotions.

I became frustrated with my situation and started searching for other jobs.  I landed an interview and was offered the position at a healthy 10% above my current salary.  The offer is for a position very similar to my current job, but I think I would be a little happier with the work I do at my current job.

Should I talk to my manager and explain how I feel, what led me to search for another position, and what it would take to keep me?  I'm hoping some of you out there have experienced something like this before, or are in HR and have witnessed a similar situation in your workplace.",2017-07-06 19:27:00
Isn't it funny that taking a year or two off after university to not pursue career is perfectly socially accepted but if you do it after a year into your first post-uni job you're an unreasonable weirdo?,27,5igus3,"A ton of my friends have taken a year or two years out to travel, do some self-discovery, while doing part-time odd jobs. I could never do such thing because I had to work all vacations to pull myself through university.

I've quit my first job after university after 15 months without having anything else lined up. Anything else than vague plans and dreams that is. I've done that for a number of reasons, not relevant here. What confuses me, is people's reaction when I tell them that I'm leaving work because... I want to do things other than work. It seems like once you join full time employment, the only valid reason to quit is moving to a different full time employment, until you retire.

Isn't it weird how just a year ago nobody would bat an eye if (given having resources to do if) I'd go off to travel, generate new experiences and to be young, but now I am perceived as making unreasonable and stupid decisions?",2016-12-15 12:36:36
Might be offered a job in the Medical Marijuana industry. Is it career suicide?,26,54bicy," I'm a relatively recent grad with a joint science degree in biology and environmental science. I'm having a hard time finding work in my field. I recently came across an ad hiring an assistant grower in an indoor medical marijuana greenhouse. With some experience working with aquatic systems and garden centres, it seems likely that I may be offered a job there. 

 This is in Toronto, Canada where marijuana legalization process is set for next year, so it may offer some potential for career growth within the industry or use the experience to work other greenhouse/natural science jobs once the industry matures. However, it's still largely controversial and it could be for some time. I'm not sure if I'm thinking right so I'm looking for advice. 

Is it a good idea to start my career in the natural sciences with a job in the medical marijuana industry here in Canada or would it be career suicide?",2016-09-24 22:00:12
What is the protocol for when you’re interested in two positions at the same company?,26,bjcf15,"I found a company that has two positions that I’m interested in. Both quite different, but fall under the umbrella of my degree.

Raise was less than I expected. What now?,27,bbc3ch,"Hi there - I'd love some outside perspective on my current situation at work.

So I've been at my current role for a year, and I just had my first annual review. It was STELLAR. The 360 review included people from practically every department, the president of the company did a review, my boss (an Executive VP), and a managing director from another office all gave me awesome feedback, as well as my peers, and people who report to me. On a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being ""well, you're being fired"" and 5 being ""you can walk on water and we are blessed to have you"", I came in at a 4.25 across the board. Even my manager said it was the highest score he's seen in his 3 years at the company. The things they identified as things I need to work on are things I identified for myself in my self-assessment, so no surprises there at all, and nothing that can't be addressed with some new processes and some training. Nothing crazy, really. 

Then, we get the part of my annual raise, and my manager says I'm getting a merit increase of 2.5%, or $3,000 ...which is definitely less than I had anticipated, especially on the heels of such a great performance review. Considering the current rate of inflation in the US is 1.5%, this is really odd to me. My manager kind of glossed over it and then moved on to discuss career progression and goals for the next quarter etc., and I didn't say anything in the moment other than ""thank you"" - but now I'm wondering if it's appropriate for me to follow up. 

I don't want to appear ungrateful - I like my job, feel appreciated by my colleagues, and in general I like what I do, but I don't see how the raise aligns with my performance. Part of me wonders why I would continue working so hard, and what a raise looks like for someone closer to a 3/5, meeting expectations.   


What would you do? Is it fair to go back to my manager and try to understand the inconsistency? Maybe ask him what I need to do to earn a better raise next year or what the factors are that determine someone's raise?",2019-04-09 22:19:58

Stigma about working blue collar from white collar?,27,axkwki,"I worked my way up in a corporate environment. I’m a manager and run a department. I’m 30f and I’m completely burned out. Job after job, boss after boss the stupid expectation to always be logged in and checking emails I’m just sick of cubical life. Completely feel trapped in an office.


My bf worked in an office for a while...but we are both introverts and really hate the constant pressure to socialize and such. He was part of a huge layoff and ended up getting a job as a janitor making more money than he used to now at $53,000 and is now union. More time off and a pension. He comes home happy every day. Loves just listening to his podcast and music and comes home stressfree. 

The ONLY thing that bugs him is the stigma. He’s so embarrassed to say he’s a janitor. He lies about what he does to friends and family. I have a friend that was complaining to us that she only makes $15/hr with a college degree but she can’t hold a job because she can’t do simple things but she said that cleaning is beneath her. So it’s a real thing that people judge. 

I’ve been begging him to get me a job working with him. But my bf doesn’t want me to feel that embarrassment about working that type of job. 
Everytime i pass a landscaper or janitor I get jealous. I don’t mind cleaning, I have a lot of respect for it bc it’s something that benefits everyone. You complete a task and you see the clean final product. In Corp America I’m forced to be as stressed as everyone about bullshit deals. 

I’ve always been so concerned about my “resume” and working up but now I just want to quit and enjoy a task oriented job. But if I do that in an office job stepping down I’d make little money. I worked stressful jobs paying $45000 or less for most of my career so far. I make more now at $70,000 but the stress doesn’t seem worth it. 

Idk what to do. Office jobs pay crap unless you are a manager or sales. I don’t know what else I could do but his job sounds great. 

Is it a bad idea to go from managing a department to custodial work?

How do I tell my boss I’m offended by my hourly rate?,26,avyb1o,"A little background...I’m a 21 yr old full time student but I work almost full time as well as an optician. I work in a small office for a doctor.  Daily, I work in sales, but also handle the inventory, do contact lens lessons, and do all of the preliminary testing with the patients. My co-workers and I are very close and the doctor has known my family for years because my grandmother worked for him. He’s a really cheap guy, we all make fun of him for it. When I started working for him 3 years ago, I thought that my hourly rate was fair as I was just out of high school and had little experience. When it came time for my review after my first year I changed my mind. I was doing way more than I thought. I didn’t realize it was such a busy and stressful job. So at my review, I told him I had given it some thought and I thought my pay was a little less than the job deserved. I asked for $2 more an hour which trust me...was not unreasonable considering what I was making. He denied my request and told me he would think about it, but I wasn’t going to get that kind of pay with my qualifications where they are now. I let it go. It’s been 3 years and I haven’t seen a raise. Minimum wage has gone up to almost what I make. Today, I stumbled across an email he sent to a few other doctors in our area asking what they pay their staff. The doctors replied saying they pay the front desk STARTING at more than what I was making after 3 years of working under him. On top of this, he emailed his consultant talking about bumping a coworkers (who started working with us almost a year and a half after me) rate up to almost 6 dollars more than I make. While she’s older, and previously worked in the industry I don’t agree that it is a good enough reason for her to get such a large raise when I haven’t seen one yet. Honestly, I feel kind of scammed. I come to work and give it my best every day, I don’t complain, I never gave him a hard time about not giving me the raise. I just thought that we had a mutual respect. I would just find another job, but they need the help I wouldn’t feel right to just leave them, he’s very flexible with my hours at school, and the office is only 10 minutes away from my school. I don’t plan to work here forever but it’s what I need while I’m finishing up my degree. He knows I’m paying for schooling on my own and don’t get financial help from anyone so I just can’t understand why he would do that to me. How could I approach talking to him about this?

-  Ask the new company for a few days to think about it?  (I’m worried about losing a potentially good offer in this case.)

Getting a Job Out of State?,26,9oddmb,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently going stir-crazy in a small midwestern town. I'm the Creative Director for an up and coming outdoor gear manufacturer. The job is fine, I don't dread coming into work everyday, I make ""okay"" money, but all the while I think of nearly nothing but relocating somewhere with more to do and see and experience.  Our company is very stuffy. Two weeks of vacation. One week of sick. No flex time. No remote working.  5 day work week and the basic holidays off. It makes the work/life balance a struggle. As an avid mountain biker and self proclaimed ""outdoorsy-type"", I've dreamed of relocating somewhere that better suits my lifestyle, hobbies, and interests.

However, I'm finding it extremely difficult to get any attention from out-of-state employers. I'd like to think I'm pretty talented, and with almost a decade of hard-earned experience, I can't help but feel like a desirable applicant. My portfolio is on-point, and I've worked with my business partner (a professional copywriter) to tune up and hone-in my resume. 

I've considered pushing my chips ""all in"", and re-locating without having a job. Living off of my savings while searching for what would then be a local job. This idea seems risky to me though. As stir-crazy as I am, I still want to make smart career moves.

I guess my long-winded question is - am I being sorted to the bottom of the applicant pile because I live out of state? Is the fact that I would need to relocate being held against me? Or is this something that I personally need to attend to in the form of a yet better portfolio website and resume?

Would preemptively moving be an unnecessary risk?

2. If I do let go, do I keep my LinkedIn as ""XXXX 2018 - present"" and bring it up only when asked?
3. If recruiters or interviewers ask, can I simply say I was ""Let go"" or even ""Laid off""? From the research I've done, it sounds like most places won't share the context of you leaving the company and just confirm the dates.
4. What is the best reason to explain it to recruiters if they ask for more details when I say I've been ""let go""? If they follow up with, were you fired or laid off, I'm not sure if they'd be able to check and it'd definitely sound better to be laid off. While I'm still employed, I've just been telling them it isn't a good cultural fit.
5. If I do get fired, I'm currently in the middle of interviewing at a few place as a currently employed individual. How do I let them know I that I've been ""let go"" in the middle of our conversations?

"How Do I Make Use of a ""Worthless"" Degree?",25,8ft5ec,"This is going to sound like the stupidest question ever, but at this point I don't care. I spent 6 years obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Creative Writing (minor in Technical Writing). I graduated in 2016, but I already had a job at the time working in the advertising department for a company. The pay is ok (salaried, approx $27k/year) but I'm still living paycheck to paycheck due to some terrible financial decisions early in life.

How does one go about finding jobs in the Creative writing or Technical Writing field? It seems dumb but other than being a book writer or editor, I don't know what else to do. I'm terrified of losing my job, as I'm remote and only a matter of time before they cut ties with all of us who work from home. I live in the Midwest, where jobs don't typically pay above $9/hr. 

I'm not expecting something to fall in my lap, but everything I search for either says become a writer or entry level tech writing jobs expect 5+ years experience. I know it's my own fault for pursuing such a broad and somewhat useless field, but I'd really love to make it work. Any advice is appreciated, truly!",2018-04-29 21:18:38
"Has anyone gone from an office job to outdoor work such as construction, survey, trail maintenence, firefighting, anything really outdoors? If so, what and how did you do it?",27,8afmht,"Hi,
I'm a 27 male and currently work an office job, and I get to do ""field"" work about 1-2 times a month. In my previous job I was moving around a lot (still inside) but it was a dynamic environment for the body. Now that I've been at a desk job for almost a year I feel pretty beat, and unhappy about the future in this type of position. 

It's not that I dislike the work persay, I just don't like sitting around all day doing computer work. I get paid decent, still have student loans (for 1.5 more years at my current payment rate). I keep thinking to myself I'll quit when my loans are paid off and go into the trades, or do something outdoors... but who knows if I will? A lot of the jobs I dream about outdoors probably wouldn't start off high paying, and I really really don't want to keep my student loans any longer than I need to. Currently I'm paid $64,000, and over the next few years I'll move up to around $83,000 assuming performance reviews go well.

Laid off. Why can't I land a job?,26,87u39f,"Hi everyone. I was laid off January 12th and I have been looking for a new job ever since. To date I have applied to over 100 positions and I have spoken to several recruiters who have not been able to help me out very much. I have also tried netoworking and that has not yielded success either. I have had 5 interviews and so far nothing has stuck. I have a few rods in the fire for possible positions, but nothing concrete.  

I personally think my ""spotty"" resume is the reason why I am not being hired or even given the chance to interview. I have worked at 5 different jobs in the last 6 years. The short time at each job can be easily explained, but I doubt most recruiters care when looking at my resume.

Example:
2012-2013: Power tool company - I left because the company was downsizing and I did not want to be left without a job.
2013-2014: Bank - I left because I was offered a much higher position at a different bank that would have taken me 2-3 years staying at the same company.
2014-2015: Bank 2 - The branch was closing and due to automation they were cutting back employees and there was no guarantee I could be absorbed elsewhere.
2015-2016: Construction - I sort of fell into this job as a coordinator and I liked it, but was offered a construction management job (years of career advancement in one jump) at a commercial real estate company.
2016-2018: Laid off after managing partners quit out of the blue.

I have been applying for all sorts of positions across all sorts of fields: coordinator, assistant project manager, entry level IT (I like working with computers), account manager, analyst, etc. in fields like construction, automotive, tech, IT, VAR, consumer products, electronics, etc. I was making $65k at my last job and would hope to earn around $50-$55K if possible.

I am not sure how I can revamp my resume, or what jobs to look for, or what I might be doing wrong. I am 32 years old, have unemployment helping me get by, but not working is driving me crazy, I have a degree is business admin., and the unemployment rate where I am in So Cal is 3.1% and according to all the recruiters I talk to is that it is insanely competitive for jobs here.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",2018-03-28 21:05:16

I'm pregnant and recently laid off. Which option is better?,26,72oxke,"I am currently 18 weeks pregnant and was just laid off from my job due to state budget cuts. I work in human services in rural Iowa. I was only in this position for 3 months as I left a position of 3 years to pursue my interest in human trafficking. I found out I was pregnant two weeks after I started. My dilemma is that I could potentially conceal my pregnancy and find a new position, but they don't have to give me FMLA if I haven't been employed there for a year thus I could be terminated if I fail to return to work when I run out of time off which would be extremely limited due to my short term employment. This potentially leaves me with two short term employment back to back in a relatively short period of time. It also potentially burns a bridge in a relatively small career field where everyone knows everyone and reputation is every thing.

"Any advice for a 24-year-old college grad with a ""useless"" degree, minimal relevant experience, and no clue what to do next?",28,4uuxai,"I am 24-years-old and I recently graduated with a B.A. in English with a minor in education. After completing my required classroom hours, I quickly realized that getting my masters in education was out of the question because I did not enjoy teaching at all. Fast forward to a few months after graduation, when I miraculously land a marketing internship for a national magazine. The only problem is I hate it.  

Unfortunately, that internship is the only valuable experience I have, and because of that, I ended up at my current position, at a local magazine managing social media and doing advertising sales. I never imagined myself in this type of career and I am so unhappy.   

I want to make a change, but I have no idea where to start and it feels like I am unqualified for everything. Since I graduated with such a useless degree I understand that I probably need to get some additional certifications but I don't know which ones would make the most sense. I can't figure out what I'm interested in. I can't decide what I should commit to. I am getting conflicting advice from everyone in my life. I am anxious that at almost 25 I still don't yet have a clear career path.   


Here is what I've learned about myself so far: I hate sales and negotiating, I hate social media marketing, I don't hate children, but I do not care for the classroom environment. I am absolutely an introvert, and I am much more motivated about finding a fulfilling and fairly flexible career rather than a high-paying one. I enjoy reading, organizing, writing proposals/reports and I don't mind monotonous tasks like building spreadsheets, etc. I would consider myself more creative thinking than logical/analytical.

24 years old. Wanting to get into programming. My options are a tech school or teaching myself. Looking for input,26,2c20pf,"Hey reddit,

Without going to far into things, I simply do not have the time and/or money to attend a traditional 4 year school. We have a local technical college that offers some classes and I've had my eye on it, but the furthest they offer is an associates in computer science. My question to all you programmers/developers out there, would I be just as well off attempting to teach myself through books and online resources? I don't mind going to school, but I'm not sure if it might be faster/more helpful for me to pick a focus (mobile dev, software dev, gaming, etc.) and put my free time in teaching myself? 

While I know a bachelors would be the ideal way to go, I've read often that coding jobs often look for applicants with the right skills as opposed to absolutely picking someone with a degree. I feel as though an associates degree is sort of looked down upon and may not even matter as long as I can prove what work I'm capable of. I was hoping someone could shed some real world experience on me and offer me some decent advice on my next step.",2014-07-29 19:41:19

How bad does it look to leave a position before you’ve reached your 1 year mark?,23,bdwfr7,"I started my current position in August and will have officially been with them for 8 months on April 20th. 

I’m so stressed all of the time. If I take one day off or even a half day off, I come back to even more stress so I barely take time off. On the days I do take time off, I can’t even enjoy it because I’m so anxious about my job and it’s miserable. My stress levels are constantly high and I even have trouble sleeping because of it. I just know I need to get out of this position and out of this side of HR in general cause I hate it so much. 

I want to apply to new jobs but feel like they will find it strange that I left so early on in my new position. I was pushing to get my 1 year under my belt but I’m burning out so fast. 

I can do the job, but the amount of stress and anxiety I feel on a daily basis is not worth what they are paying me to do this job. I’m solely here to make money to live life outside of work and I can’t even do that now because it occupies my mind 24/7.

I have seen people be rejected due to not having a good explanation for why they left a company so early on, so I’m hyper aware of it and nervous it’ll look bad to new employers. I’d be okay with staying with this company but want to move onto something else and they have rule that you can’t move into a new position until after your 1 year mark.

Prior to graduating I worked the “typical” jobs -retail, a restaurant, an internship, and then in sales. None of these have lasted particularly long due to needing to change (school schedule, finding something better, etc.).

Negotiating salary when moving to higher COL area?,26,ajelkt,"I've been interviewing for jobs, and I just got to the point of salary negotiations with one of them. I'm a little stumped on what to ask for (they haven't given me any numbers from their end yet).

I currently make $63,700/year in Lancaster, PA, and this job is in Poughkeepsie, NY. The COL calculators show that Poughkeepsie has a 19.4% higher COL than Lancaster. If I were staying in Lancaster, I would be looking for a 10-15% raise to $70-73k. In Poughkeepsie, I need to make $76k just to break even with the COL difference.

The problem is, Poughkeepsie doesn't think it's a high COL area. Even though they're technically in the NYC commute area, they consider themselves to be closer to Albany. I was discussing salary with a company in Albany, and he told me that their offer would be \~$72k (Albany's COL difference to Lancaster is \~9%, so this equates to only a 4% raise). My offer in Poughkeepsie is from a fairly small company, so they don't have relevant salary data available on Glassdoor, but I've seen similar job descriptions from other companies list salaries of $55-60k, and on Glassdoor similar companies in the area seem to have salaries of $60-70k.

Right now, I'm thinking of starting the conversation by asking for $82k (COL increase + 8% raise), but I know it's going to be way too high for them. They're probably hoping to pay me \~$70k. Do you have any advice for this conversation, and how to maximize my salary offer? While I am willing to sacrifice salary for the growth opportunities at this new company, I would hate to leave money on the table because I didn't do a good job of handling the salary conversation.

"I have an interest in military strategy, security, and international politics. What career do you think is best for me?",23,9kiyow,"I've always had an interest in the field of espionage, military strategy, understanding how conflicts between countries start, how countries ensure peace, etc. 

I've been thinking about doing a masters and switching to a new career route. I know what I've described above is a broad general field, but I was wondering what specific jobs there are in this field that I can get into.

The thing is I don't really know if I'll be good at this or not. I'm more of a right brain dominant person than a left brainer. I'm not good at math or any of the STEM fields. What I am good at is creative writing. And I like coming up with ideas, finding solutions to problems, and political philosophy. One subject I really enjoyed at school was economics. I liked learning about how the economy worked and how different cogs in the system affected each other. 

I've heard of courses such as security studies and war studies, but its been unclear to me what jobs exactly those courses can lead to.

Is there a job out there in this field that requires you to utilize your creative writing skills, knowledge in politics, and problem solving skills? Or something similar like that? Perhaps a job where you work alongside the military to develop strategic plans?

And If I go down this career route, is employment only possible in the government? Or is there employment in the private sector too, in this field? 

Also this might sound naive but a large part of my interest in this field stems from spy novels, strategy video games and espionage themed movies. I don't know how different it will be in reality.

I’m currently 20 (21 in december), i suffer from really bad depression and anxiety and it has really hindered the last 4 years of my life (2 at sixth form, 2 at uni, now dropped out). I’ve gotten a house share where my uni is as i don’t really have much left at home to go back to and i think it is nicer here.

I’m awaiting therapy but it takes a long time and i need to pay bills somehow, i don’t feel capable of working a full 40 hours/week, i really think i just couldn’t handle it mentally/emotionally; however i kinda have to work 20+ to be able to live (£400 rent and assuming just under £8/hour wage).

I have decent qualifications (B in A-Level Maths, 2 A\*s 3As 4Bs at GCSE), i’ve been trying to find a job for a couple of months but only in specific fields (trainee accountant/actuary), my only real passions are gaming, maths (calculus) and i love animals, in any of these 3 fields i believe i could genuinely work a full-time job.

I have no experience and interviews are pretty hard because i have no confidence in my ability outside of maths. I’d really prefer for this not to be another shitty year as i’ve had 4 really shit years in a row, so ideally i would do something i won’t despise. Do i just have to settle for doing something that’s gonna kill me inside? Any potential help/paths/input would be amazing, i know it’s long and rambly, sorry.",2018-09-22 17:36:18
Finding purpose and/or passion?,24,9g66n2,"I've been wanting/thinking about changing career directions for years. It's very confusing for me. There's a lot of advice out there that suggests I follow my passion. Other advice is often  ""find your purpose"". I'm quit fortunate to be in a situation where I don't have to work for money, I can go back to school (if needed for desired career) and I can take my time to find out what to do. I'm good at and enjoy a wide variety of things, so that doesn't help me narrow it down.

I'm currently a classical musician and have had many people in my life assume or tell me they believe that music is my passion.  However, I don't believe that I am passionate about it. 

How does one know what they are passionate about(as far as career)? What about finding purpose in a career? 

I'm keeping this post pretty short, which means I'm leaving out a lot of info. Feel free to ask me questions and TIA!

Should I drop my PhD?,25,9cv3e7,"I am about to start my third and last year of PhD in Statistics. I have hated pretty much all of it, but the last year has been horrible. I pretty quickly realized this is not the job for me and I'm not meant to do this. It's been a downward spiral during the last year especially. I don't even know why I did it. I applied before graduating (MSc) without even thinking about it, got in and never even thought if I actually wanted to do it.

Now I have only one year left, but it is for sure going to be utterly depressing for me. I'm 25 and I don't want to be constantly angry, sad and hateful over a job. I just want a normal job, with normal working hours and normal coworker interactions. I don't even want to pursue the academic career.

I don't think it would be impossible for me to find another job in a reasonable time. But it just feels so incredibly stupid to give up now. I feel like I've been given an amazing opportunity and I'm throwing it away.

I really can't figure out what to do, so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.





EDIT: Ok, I've been gone for a few hours for a legit crying session. So many replies, honestly thanks to all of you. Both sides of suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

I think some of what I wrote was not clear and I should have included that I'm not american. In my university system you do 3 years of BSc (with honours? Is that a thing?) + 2 years of MSc which I concluded in 2016. I started my PhD one week after completing my masters.

Also, I don't hate statistics. My R/Python/SQL skills are on point and I would love to be a data analyst. I just hate the research job.

Anyway, I have set a plan. I'll talk to my supervisor tomorrow. Let him know what I'm going through. Evaluate the possibility of a six-month break, which is written in my contract. Leaving for good is the last option, which I'll consider if my mental state degenerates more than it already has.",2018-09-04 15:21:50
What jobs allow you to teach without being a teacher?,25,8v6qy1,"I work in the media industry as a researcher/producer and am looking at a career change. When I think about the thing I enjoy most and would like to do every day, it's getting to talk to and interact with people while educating them about subjects I value. I have a tertiary education in both history and conservation and would love to do something with that. 

I know I don't want to be a school teacher. I also can't pursue casual employment (e.g. tour guide) or go back to full time study, because I have financial commitments that prevent it. 

Are there any other careers out there where this is possible?

Should I trade up a higher income for a lower income so that I can get on a different ladder? $120K trade to $100K.,26,8h0yg2,"** .:: Edit: WOW!  Thank you for the responses I've gotten, it's been super encouraging and I just want to say I really appreciate it!  It's definitely solidified my plan. ::. **

---

I have been so strangely horribly conflicted with this.  Hopefully getting some opinions will ease my mind.

I was pretty much presented with the option I always wanted and now fear it dreadfully.  Either the grass-is-greener syndrome or I simply can't be made happy.

**Current:  **

-Waiter: $89K

-Online Work for restaurants: $32K

-Total Comp: $121K+

**Perks**: 6 work hours a day.  ~1 Month off a year between slow days off and scheduled vacations.  Simple website updates once main development work is done totallying maybe 5-10 minutes a day if that.  No commuter traffic.  Minimum wage increases drive menu prices which drive tips based on percentage of menu prices.  ~5% income increase annually.

**Cons**: Exhausted when I get home and my kid is asleep.  No upward mobility, not climbing a ladder at all. This is a job, not a career.  Can't move away because there aren't many opportunities like this.  Super difficult to purchase a home here so I would reside to renting.  I feel stuck where I am and just turning cogs.

**New Offer**: 

-Web/Network Admin for the restaurant.

-$100K Salary

-Will need to give up my online business as they are my primary client.

-8 hour work days + travel + commuter traffic.

**Pros**: I'm on an actual ladder I can climb.  I'll be home to see my family before they are actually in bed.  I drop the social stigma about being a waiter.  I will have options to move on in the future and increase my income further.  I have been studying for my Networking Certs and this will look great on my resume.  I can stop waiting tables which has it's ups and downs (lots of negativity).  I would be able to find comparable jobs and actually move my family away to an area where houses aren't $1M+ and everyone is getting outbid.

**My conflict** is the drop in income and I think I'm a bit scared of moving into the unknown for some reason.  Any thoughts would help me qwell my mind.  Thank you!",2018-05-04 20:22:24
How did you find your strengths and your career that you enjoy? I can't figure mine out,25,8fjd9q,"I'm trying to find my skills/talents that would convert over to a career that will lead to a life where I have extra time with my family. I think I'd like a more hands on career, but I know my genetics are not so great so it's possible my body will be destroyed in 5 years if I were to get a straight construction job, not to mention I'm not the construction worker personality.  

Anyway, my main issue is that *everything* seems interesting to me and I tend to find something that's my ""next newest career !!!!!""^1 I get super excited and obsessed with learning about this new career/skill/trade that I'll spend weeks to a month or 2 just absorbed. Then, I hit a wall. My ability doesn't match what I thought my ability was not to mention the requirements for that industry, and I realize I was looking at the career with rose colored glasses (or perhaps a grass is greener view since that career wasn't my current frustrating job), plus  the usual schooling requirements. Did I mention the idea of going to school frustrates me to no end? I've just decided I'm not a sit 'n learn person, I can read the same paragraph 5 times and still have no idea what I read, but give me a tool and tell me what to do on the other hand and I'm there. 

I like Marcus buckingham's Strength definition^2, ""a strength is what you get exciting thinking about, while you do it you lose track of time, and when you're done you may be exhausted but you're energized"". That got me thinking that I love fixing things around my house, tell me to replace the trim around the backdoor and prevent it from rotting? Re-caulk the bathtub to prevent the floor rotting from a child splashing? I'm all over that shit. If my lawnmower doesn't work, I research the model, any common issues, how to take it apart and then I'm tearing into it and boom it's 2 hours later and I may have a lawn mower working. On the other hand, if I don't have the correct tools I may try to improvise, if I do and it works great, if and when it doesn't then something tends to get broke/stripped, I am super pissed off afterwards and I've just made it worse. 



Then while at work, I realized that 1 of my weaknesses is that I feel weak when I'm being rushed and do not feel I completed a job to the standard/vision in my head. I'll work slow in the beginning to make sure everything looks nice, then towards the end I get irritated at the person that scheduled the job (thinking they did it on purpose just ""out to get to me"", which I've realized is not the case and is something I've noticed about myself), finish the job not to my standards and say screw it. 


1. I end up watching videos, thinking I can do the exact same thing and then after buying tools doing whatever it was for a little bit, I get bored and move on. 


2. Because, unlike everywhere else, he actually has a way to figure out your strengths. Other people say ""What are you good at?"", I don't know I suck at most everything and am mediocre at best!


P.s self-assessments/career quizzes match up to the flavor of the month career, 1 week it'll say ""you're career is IT yay!"" then the next week it'll be ""You're career is X"", because that just happens to be what I was obsessing over that week.  ",2018-04-28 14:40:18
"Been at my first job for less than a year, is it too soon to quit?",26,8csnt5,"Some context...

Started a new job fresh out of school last year and was told that I'd be training under one of the employees so that when it came time to retire, they'd already have a replacement trained (they're the ""on-site expert"" and only they can give me any training). 

It's been almost a year and I have yet to be put on a project or shadow the employee to see what exactly they do, or receive any type of meaningful work (mainly odd-jobs that lasted a few days sprinkled between months of waiting around). 

I've basically been sitting at my desk reading relevant topic papers and learning from textbooks trying to train myself for almost a year, but I won't be able to learn anything until I actually get to work on a project (I've voiced my frustrations to my manager and told him I can't keep getting left out to dry. It's at the point that I'm embarrassed when asked what projects I've worked on because all I have to say is ""I haven't""). 

I'm also told by other employees that there isn't a lot of work coming in for the foreseeable future, which means I won't have any work to do in the coming months either (so basically almost a year of waiting around, followed by another indefinite amount of time waiting around but, this time, lay-offs are a much bigger concern).

I'm the type of person who needs to always be working on something or have something to keep me busy, and these past few months have been KILLER just sitting at a desk twiddling my thumbs (my days have basically consisted of going into work, getting coffee, and finding papers to read that might help me learn something).

Should I ride this one out and hope I don't get laid off, or should I start polishing off my resume and applying myself elsewhere?

How can I get out of the restaurant industry when I have plenty of schooling and no career direction?,25,82a4os,"I’m a 28 year old female living in Toronto. I’ve been working in the restaurant industry for the last 5 years, taking school courses on and off to try and find a career I like. And yet I’m still so confused and have no idea how to pick a direction and get out of the industry. 

I have a BA in Communications and Fine Arts Culture studies. This university degree was so broad. I took courses in art, advertising, film, photography, sociology and even dance. Nothing was narrowed down and I left school still very confused.

I did a part time program in copywriting because I thought advertising was a good field. But that never panned out because I lost the enjoyment of it after realizing the culture of the industry seemed very douchy and cut throat. 

I then decided that I really wanted to focus on film. Because I’ve always loved the industry and working on set. I had worked as a PA in some small productions and loved it. 

Got a certificate in screenwriting from a local college. Liked it, but wasn’t prepared for how competitive it was and how poor I would be struggling to make it work. 

So I got a certificate in Makeup Artistry. I love makeup and I love special fx and working on set. I worked hard for 2 years, set up my own business and hustled hard to try and get into a Union. But i got rejected and realized that I couldn’t afford to live in a major city in my own apartment and rely on freelance work. So I’ve been working random makeup jobs on the side while still at my restaurant job. 

Basically, I’ve gotten used to making really good money at the restaurant and I’m so hesitant to get into something else and take a major pay cut when I live by myself paying $1,200 in rent a month. 

I’m scared to take a leap and fail and not be able to live comfortably.  I’m frustrated at paying tuition for school and nothing panning out. I’ve realized I hate office jobs and I need to be able to work with my hands, be creative and interact with people. Being stuck behind a desk 9-5 everyday is my nightmare. 

I have zero direction on a career path and what my options could be. At the same time I’m terrified to get stuck working at the restaurant for the rest of my life. ",2018-03-06 00:45:12

I will be approaching my 2 year anniversary at the company soon. I am based in Los Angeles, California.

I enjoy my job, but I want to make more money.

What are some remote jobs or freelance work that someone can do from home and make 40k a year?,25,7ng9id,"I’m looking for some career advice for my wife. 

For the last 14 years she has been working as a personal assistant / legal admin for a small law firm of 5 employees. She made about 22k a year. She has an associate’s degree in legal administration assistant. She is in the process of leaving that job for a number of reasons:

1.	She has become too close to her boss and their working and personal relationship has become blurred. You can see how this can cause some problems. For instance, her boss will give certain employee’s days off when it snows and she is expected to come in the office.  

2.	She hasn’t been given a chance to do any meaningful work as of late. She is interested in doing actual work like working on wills, deeds, and court documents. Besides just answering the phone, her tasks as of late have become personal assistant type tasks like food shopping, picking up her boss’ dog, cleaning up her bosses dog poop, and other task like that.

3.	For the last three years my wife has been working on a pet sitting / dog walking business on the side. As of late, her business has become consistently busy and she is making enough from it part time to justify quitting her job. Having a job with set times and a set location and working the business on the side have become too hard for her.  

This is where she needs some suggestions on what to do next.

She is okay with the dog business being her only income for the time being, but it’s not something she wants to do forever. She is currently looking for work that she can do from home alongside the pet sitting that can turn into something that will replace it in the future.

She wants to do some kind remote assistant job or do some kind of freelance work. 

Her current idea is to be a freelance resume writer, but she doesn’t know where to start with that. She was looking in online courses like Resume Writing Academy. Her problem is that she doesn’t know if any of these online course or training and certification programs are legitimate.

Any advice on this would be a great help.

Starting back college at the age of 30....am I making the right decision?,25,7h6fze,"Wanna make sure I'm making the right decision here. Life changing stuff.

    Painting the picture..

Single male, 30 years old. Living in central Arkansas. No kids. **No debt**. I went to college when I was 18 years old after being in the top echelon & AP classes in all of my junior through high school years and went to college for 2 years, but only got credit for 1 year of classes cause I withdrew or failed the others. I was always the shy kid growing up and had only a couple of friends. Never went to a party, never dated, nothing. College gets here and I have my first drink. I move in with now 4 friends in a 2 bedroom apartment on campus. I GM a chain of video game stores and rack up a good 50 hours a week, while taking 12 hours of classes. Long story short, something had to break and I never had a direction in school. I was going to do Film, but the school didn't offer that program yet. Admittedly, I just went to college cause I was a dumb 18 year old and we are all sent to college with the idea of ""Figure It Out"". Thankfully, instead of spending more thousands of dollars on a degree that I'm not quite sure would have financially got me anywhere, I dropped out. But, that was after passing all of my classes the last semester to get myself out of academic probation. So, left in good standing.

-
Spent the next few years going from job to job after the owner of the video game franchise fucked up his personal finances with his 8 businesses and had to declare bankruptcy. I paid off the $15,000 I owed the university for my fucking shit up. Found a fantastic bartending position at 24 years old. Started making around $40k a year. Which is a ton for a single, bachelor guy without any responsibilities and in a very low cost of living state. So, kind of partied for the rest of my 20's and went on vacations. Saw a ton of shows, went to Bonnaroo 11 times (couple of times as a teenager), traveled, did cool shit. Had a good time.

    Now..

I'm 30. Don't want to bartend the rest of my life FOR SURE. Hate working until 3AM. I hate most of the 21 year olds that come in the bar. There's no career path with this job, I've been at the glass ceiling for 5 years now and I DEFINITELY don't want to manage. And one day I want to start a family. Also, I'm overrrr the party life. I hardly touch drinking. I went almost a year without drinking recently (damn 30th birthdays). I'm just ready to be..... a 30 year old, I suppose.
-
* Time to get shit done, son.
-
So, I enrolled back at my old university. Pretty big school. They accepted me back immediately. I was looking at Computer Science initially after a frustrating 6 month span of redditing and talking to people and pulling all of my hair out. I was enjoying some courses on Team Treehouse. But, I ended up talking to some very like minded friends who urged me to do MIS (Management Information Systems) instead. Same job path, same career trajectory, same pay (perhaps a little lower ceiling on pay, but I don't need to make $200k a year), but wayyy more people skills involved (which I excel at) and business classes instead of advanced math classes in the course. Still learn programming. My buddy's company literally just hired 2 guys for the same job. One was CS. One was MIS. Same job. Same pay.
-
MIS & CS opportunities are growing substantially in Arkansas. If you're not from Arkansas, you probably think this place is redneck and backwoods. But, if you grew up here, you know it's an amazing place with an awesomeeee low cost of living. I love the place. Also, looks like it is very likely an Amazon warehouse will be moving in just 25 minutes away from me in the next few years. Which could line RIGHT up with me finishing up my degree. Could be perfect. 
-
Now, I'm not going to lie. A big reason why I chose MIS, outside of the confidence of succeeding in the field, is the pay. You don't walk off that stage making less than $60k a year. That's almost twice what I'm doing now and that's just starting pay. 
-
I'm going to the University of Central Arkansas. Which has an excellent program for MIS. 
-
    Now, the financial stuff..
My first semester back, I'm taking just 3 classes to get back in the groove. Microeconomics to get it out of the way cause it's required for MIS, Biology for a gen ed, and Nutrition for another gen ed that's easy to pad the GPA stats. I signed up for the best professors & classes literally 2 minutes after the 5 AM window opened for picking classes. I'm not fucking this shit up like my dumb ass 18 year old self.
-
I'm still at my bartending job. Despite wanting to move on with my life, I thankfully work with some of my best friends and I make good money. Also, most importantly, because of my seniority, they can work with my class schedule. So, this is what I have devised:
-
    Class Day Schedule:
    - 9:30AM-10:40AM
    - 12:15PM-1:30PM
    - 2:40PM-3:55PM

    MON: Off
    TUE: Class Day Schedule
    WED: 3PM-5PM Lab
    THU: Class Day Schedule & Work @ 9PM-3AM
    FRI: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SAT: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SUN: Work 8PM-3AM

- I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting off at 3 AM the night of having to get to class at 9:45AM.
- Thursdays are gonna suck, it's possible I can occasionally work those. But, Scott Steiner math suggests I Don't Be A Pussy and just red bull it up and work that Thursday anyways.
-
    Work Info:
    With those 4 days of working, I should be able to pull $600-$700 a week.
    Knock off one night and move it to 3 days of working, $500-$600 a week.

    Utilities
My rent is around **$550** a month after utilities splitting a 1,500 square foot home with 2 roommates. Being older and having experience with having up to 7 roommates at the same time, I just can't do more than 2. Preferably, I'd be by myself, but the world is not perfect. Oh, and I'm a 5 minute drive away from campus.

* ***Food cost is around $400ish*** as I also do some bodybuilding and the occasional dates with the lady.

* The rest of my bills between health insurance, phone bill, gym, netflix, Adobe Suite (sidework), etc is about **$430 a month**. Sooooo..

* Bills + Rent/Utilities + Food = **roughly $1,400 a month**

* Working 4 days with stacking one work night a week on class schedule, I should be able to roughly expect **$2,400 a month.**

**Leaves $1,000 aside** for anything in the world that could happen. Life shit. I also have a girlfriend. She is very supportive and awesome and is more frugally minded anyways. So, we can have just as good of a time hanging out at home vs. going out often.

    But Student Loans Now...my main inquiry..
I'm expecting to be able to get grants and possibly scholarships next semester in the fall after I get my GPA up and I have this time of the year to apply.

* I can get 2 loans with my university. Subsidized which will cover my tuition this semester ($3,100). Along with an unsubsidized loan for $5,300. I obviously need the subsidized loan so I can have my tuition covered. The unsub I'm wrestling around with.
* In all honesty, I'm not too concerned about getting into debt with student loans, because I will be increasing my earnings from **$40k a year** full time before college *(which, the timeline left on that job is probably only 2 years max and I do not want to continue that line of work)* to starting at **$60k a year**. Possibly up to **$80k a year** and then with some years of working, I could get up to over **$100k** easily.

So, $40k-$50k in student loan debt seems more of a Spend Money to Make Money situation to me.

* If I took both the sub & unsub loans. That would also allow me to not worry about work. Be able to give shifts up when I need to for extra studying/project time. As, it has been 10 years since I've been in school. Now, I'm serious about it and want to be at the top of my class in every class. This is my future in my hands.

* Taking the $5,300 unsub loan would give an extra $1,000+ a month during school that could be used to cover all of my living expenses.

Then, the money I make at work? I save.

* Obviously, I'm taking on debt. So, I'm not exactly saving. But, I save that money until I graduate, then I can put an immediate HUGE dent into my student loans. And, I also have the money for anything that comes up, such as moving into a new place. Car breaking down. Etc, etc. Which brings me toooooo...

*      Should I buy a house?**

I currently live in a rent house. It's $1,150 a month before utilities that I split with 2 other roommates. I've already lived in the same city for 10 years. And with school, I'm locked in for another 3 years. 

* My credit score is 717.

Of course, that's before the loans. That's right now. After rent and utlities (I pay more for the bigger room with its own bathroom), I'm averaging $550 a month. Sometimes a little lower, sometimes a little higher. I could see me and my girlfriend eventually wanting to move in together. 

* My lease is up in May and then it moves to month to month. 

My current situation is fine. But, staying here for school the next 3 years, rent minus utilities....just rent, is gonna cost me **$15,000+.**

* Perhaps I should buy a house instead? I could get something decent for around $110k-$140k. That's 1,200-1,500 square foot, 3 beds & 2 bathrooms usually. I could still have a roommate/my girlfriend pay me rent so I'm not eating the whole thing.

If I need to move after graduating, I could just make it a rent house.

How normal is it to be bored at work?,26,6rd4l1,"I currently work an entry-level job that I've been at for about a year. My job is project-based, and unless we have a deadline approaching, I probably spend at least half my day with nothing to do. 

I've talked to my project managers about this. I know to ask others in the office if they have anything they need help with; they rarely do. I am not incompetent, I just get my work done a lot faster than many of my coworkers, and a lot of my job entails emailing and calling people and waiting for them to get back to me. 

I'm not opposed to the idea of sitting at my desk online shopping or browsing Facebook or whatever for half the day, but I want the company to feel I'm important and valuable. We had layoffs about 5 months ago and I'm constantly afraid I'll be next if I don't at least pretend to be busy. I also really love my industry and want to be more challenged.

I have worked for my current company for the better part of a decade. When i first started with them i was a wreck personally and professionally.

Am I being a bad employee?,25,b7cye9,"I missed a staff meeting. 100% wrong and I was quite embarrassed. I fully expected to be reprimanded for that. But then I wasn't, and I was instead reprimanded for treating my hours too flexibly.

This really annoyed me. Here is the back story on why:

I am salary

I work 60-65 hours a week, I do some amount of work 7 days a week

I don't take lunches 

My life really does revolve around my job and they are getting huge amount of hours from me a week

I don't have consistent in and out times, which I think is what's annoying my employers. Some days I go in at 6:30am, some days my wife is home from work and I go in at 10am. I never saw a problem with this bc I am allowed to take lunch, I don't, and when my wife isn't working I'll just use that lunch hour in the morning.

**story time** A few weeks ago, I had 50 hours by Friday morning and it was beautiful out so I wanted to leave and just get some more hours working a full day on Saturday or Sunday instead of the usual 1/2 day. I asked my boss, hey does your specific time in the office matter or just total time, and mentioned my above plan. My boss didn't like that, and said but you can leave earlier this afternoon.

So out of all that I got 3 ""flexible"" hours of being gone before the office closed.

Since then my boss has brought up the draw back if flexible hours or made a comment about my flexible schedule 5 times. They had a minor issue when I wasn't in the office at 5:30 after working 10 hours already, and said I wasn't there bc of my flexible schedule.

I just received a disciplinary letter after I missed a meeting. The letter doesn't mention the meeting, scheduling, organization, respect for others time. It discusses my taking flexibility for granted and how I now have a set time block to be in the office.

I really feel like 60 hours work weeks aren't flexible and that I'm being needlessly cut up. Are my feelings on this unreasonable?

**edit - thank you for the responses. 1 thing I should have clarified, I'm in an industry that bills out to clients, so that's why there is such emphasis on hours. My career plan has my goal at billing x amount of hours to clients and those hours are more than 40, which is why I'm putting in so many hours. I do like my job a lot, the work is engaging and the company has a wonderfully organized and direct process so I always know exactly what I am responsible for and should be doing. It's just very pleasant work to do. I've been different places and the work isn't as enjoyable because the process is sloppy. The only thing grinding my gears is people acting like taking breakfast or choosing to work my overtime at an odd hour is somehow slacking off.**

**With the billiable hours it is known how many hours I am putting in each week, we do a time report every day. But yes I agree with many that the visual bias is what's killing me.**",2019-03-30 19:15:44
"When applying to jobs that don't require it, is including a Cover Letter a good idea or overkill?",25,av4q5w,"I am currently in a job that has been emotionally really unhealthy for me. Because of that, I feel like it is time for me to set sail and look for new jobs. I am a student in my junior of college, so currently jobs I am applying to are small ones like markets, coffee shops, pet stores, things like that where I would work 14 hours a week, then plan on working 30 once summer hits.

For two of these jobs so far, I have written a cover letter for each job on why I would like the job, and why I would be a good fit. My question is, for jobs like these, where it is not specifically asked for, would writing a cover letter show my dedication and ambition, or does it just seem like overkill that may turn a potential employer off? 

As a follow up question, many of these jobs I am applying for have nothing to do with the career field I will be pursuing out of college, which is game development and/or esports. That being said, I have a lot of leadership experience and skills revolving around those two career fields that I have gained in school, and which fills up my resume a significant portion. Should I keep these leadership skills such as my student orgs on there even though it has nothing to do with the jobs being applied for, or take them off?

Should I leave a job I love after 10 years for a 20% raise?,24,9qss2k,"I’m 42 and at a large F500 company. It’s consistently been ranked a top place to work in IT. I’ve been here for 9 years and was promoted to manager 3 years ago. I have a good salary (maybe a little underpaid), but I also have great work/life balance, interesting projects, and good people. We lost some good people (leaders and staff) to great opportunities this year, mostly bc they weren’t able to move up. New leadership will most likely change some things. 

I recently got a call from a recruiter, which turned into an interview with a much smaller privately-owned competitor. I haven’t been able to figure out how well they’re doing (they’re not ranked in the top 100 for the industry). I’d have more responsibility building a consulting practice, but few resources to do it. It’d be a risk for both sides and a huge learning curve. I told them I’d be looking for 20% more than my current base, plus a bonus. They said the first round interview went well and they want me for a second round. If I don’t get a good offer, then problem solved. The whole thing is causing me stress bc I’m comfortable and don’t believe I’m qualified to make the switch from running an IT team to leading a practice.

"Gap in experience, gap in skills...gap in education. How do I find a sustainable job?",24,8xrmrw,"I was laid off over 2 years ago for a job I no longer hold, I had since found a part time job while keeping that job, but it's not nearly enough to make ends meet (around $300 a month). I have been on many interviews for positions i've applied to in my field (Graphic Design), however because these companies do the usual ""ignore after interview"" or ""sorry we went with another candidate"" thing that a lot of people deal with, I feel like I can't really achieve getting the job I want. It is making me demoralized.

To make it worse, I am in my mid 30s and I have an associates in science (my major was graphic design), and I never could afford to continue my education. So, after I completed my associates I was hired at the company I had worked for for 3 1/2 years before it went under due to poor management and people leaving left and right. Was unable to claim unemployment, etc etc, my ex boss took advantage of her employees and really tried to screw every employee that worked for her hard and since then, my ""career"" has been in shambles.

I have a linkedin, I have connections from college and friends in my field, since everyone says ""build connections."" How do I go about doing that? I don't have anyone from my previous job anywhere that I can interact with.

I feel like i'm in a catch-22-situation; I can't seem to get a job in retail because I lack retail experience (only had 2 retail jobs before going to college) and then of course when I go to interviews for graphic design/media/digital art jobs, I feel like i'm competing with people who have bachelors degrees. I also feel like i'm too old to go back to school and get a bachelors in my field, I don't really have the money to do so. I can ""find"" tons of jobs, I just can't get hired at any of them, of course

I know what I can do and i'm pretty sure of my skills in design.

I am just very tired of taking dead end, pocket change jobs where I can hardly afford my rent and usually spend most of that of transportation TO the job just because I ""need the job."" It is depressing to me that I cannot seem to forge a career, I have to constantly and consistently struggle, and then I see everyone around me and my friends and family with careers they enjoy and I barely have one at my age. So why can't I find one?

I don't see what the point is of getting these jobs if I cannot really afford to pay my most basic living expenses like rent. and I don't want to rely on state assistance to buy food. I don't have a car because can't actually afford one, so ... it's a pretty ridiculous situation.

Anyone in this same situation? I have considered starting my own freelance business but I am unsure of how that works, and I wouldn't know where to start.   I am constantly redesigning my resume and re-organizing information but it doesn't seem to help or be good enough.

It's too late to change careers, and I wouldn't know anything else I could possibly do for a career. It seems nearly impossible, to be honest. Is it too late for me?

What do you do when you graduate with a degree and realize you don't love it anymore?,23,867rpk,"So, I'm about to graduate this summer and I'm feeling lost and depressed. I used to be so excited about this future, working towards it. But over the past year and a half, I've lost the passion. I began to dread going to work to do it. I felt stagnant, and the thought of doing it for the rest of my life made me upset.

I wanted to go into Video Production/Broadcasting, and work in boxing -- specifically in boxing or UFC as a reporter.
Sounds good, right? But I have no desire to actually do it. Which is frustrating because I've built my resume up so much to finally just quit working towards it in the last year.

So, I took a scuba diving class. Loved it. I've always loved swimming, it comes so natural. I loved it so much that I went to Key Largo and got certified. Being underneath the water and exploring coral reefs is -- by far -- one of the most beautiful and exhilarating things to do.

I also witnessed dolphin trainers in action. That was my childhood dream, was to be a dolphin trainer or marine biologist, up until 14 when I got into sports and decided to be a reporter. Well, when I saw dolphin trainer's in action, I almost teared up. It looked amazing. Everyone knows how obsessed I am with these creatures, and I realized how deeply in love I am with the ocean and its creatures. I always have been, but this reminded me.
But here I am about to graduate with a communications degree. I'm scared of how unsure I'm feeling. I'm scared to tell my parents and have them feel that they wasted their money. I'm scared that I won't make any money (because dolphin trainers and even scuba jobs won't make you rich).

And it's even more frustrating when my brother is going to work on wall street, my sister a doctor and my other sis in physics. So, then maybe I should just ignore it and try to get to ESPN.
What I would love to do... is work with dolphins and scuba dive and videography. Maybe underwater videography which would include scuba diving that goes out and shoots marine animals like dolphins? Hell, who am I kidding. I need to start looking for a job soon. It's like I don't even care now if I get rejected from places in boxing or UFC.
I guess I'd just appreciate advice from anyone who's felt like this, who's been in the same situation and what they ended up doing.

EDIT: I just asked my mom about her thoughts of interning at a dolphin training place (I had a opportunity when I got SCUBA certified) and she shot it down, saying, ""Well, it's not in your major...""",2018-03-22 04:25:19

"My boss says I am too valuable to be promoted, how can I navigate this?",25,80p32l,"I work for a small family owned business (about 100 employees). I am in my mid twenties, I've worked there part time for 5 years while going to school and have been there full time for about 3 years now. The owners and managers all like me as I am a hardworking and lucrative employee. I was promoted from the warehouse to a sales position about 2 years ago and I now am consistently the highest performing sales person in my department. 

There is an open position that I am interested in that would be a promotion to a different department. The manager of this department would like me to work for her and we have talked about the possibility several times. The only problem is that when she mentioned this possibility of me moving departments to the president/owner he responded with a flat no, saying that I am too valuable to the department that I am currently in. (Without revealing too much, this business requires salespersons to have a highly specialized knowledge and I would be difficult to replace.)

I am not very interested in staying in my current position for the long haul (i.e. my entire professional career) because there is not any meaningful room for growth or promotion in my current department. The job is commission based, I am already selling the most in my department and I am making just under 40k a year. Seeking another job would either require me moving to a new city or working in a different field as my current company is the largest of its kind in the area.

"I’m about to receive an offer for a job that pays well below my potential, but I’ve been out of a job for nearly a year; should I take it?",23,78pdyp,"I got laid off from my job about a year ago. I’m a grad student, so I took advantage of having a decent savings, unemployment pay and support of my family to focus on school after I lost my job while casually looking for the next step in my career. As time went by, I looked harder for jobs, but the job market has been unforgiving here and it’s hard to even land an internship. 

I don’t want to reveal too many details, so I apologize for being vague, but I recently interviewed for a company who really liked me for the role, but they have told me they won’t be able to pay me what I’m asking and they’re concerned I may just be taking this job to make a few bucks and quit when I find something better. Nonetheless, the hiring manager called and told me he wants to make an offer, but I won’t find out what the offer is until I meet with him soon. 

The position has a lot of growth potential and even though it doesn’t align directly with my career path now, if I do grow at this organization, it’ll be useful in my career. The position, at where I would start, is rather unglamorous work involving making lots of warm calls all day. 

I expect I’ll be offered something along the lines of $45-55k/year, which is about $30K/year less than my last job and IF I can land a good gig along my career path, I can probably get paid $80K+, now that I’m about to graduate with my masters. 

With all that said, should I take this job?

I’m rather tempted to take it so long as I can pay my bills, or at least dramatically reduce the financial burden I’m placing on my parents. I’ve been told I should take it and keep looking for better opportunities, but I feel really guilty about that sort of thing, especially since I’m being referred by friends for this job. 

What do you guys think? Thanks!!",2017-10-25 20:49:52

Is it ethical to accept a job knowing full well I'm going to quit in 12 months?,25,6kvr75,"I recently got an engineering degree. While I love engineering, it was really just the first step in a long term plan I've had for a while. The plan has always been get an engineering degree, get one of those primo engineering jobs, save up some money and move to California to be a musician. Engineering was a few birds one stone deal, but I never wanted a career in it. 

So right now I'm in stage 2. I've got the degree and I'm about to accept a local job that pays great. My plan is to work long enough to get about 20k in savings while simultaneously trying to find a job on the west coast. Ideally, this time next year I'll be out there.

Can anyone provide guidance for a 25 year old who was fired from his job yesterday and has no idea what career path to take?,24,5u2tcv,"To start off, I have a 4 year B.A. degree in advertising. I was let go yesterday from a marketing/advertising job for not being able to fully grasp the job and meet expectations.

Next week would have been my 4th month in that position.

5 Ways to Display Confidence in a Job Interview,25,218xxf,"Lately, I have been helping a number of clients with interview preparation. We spend a lot of time reviewing industry relevant interview questions and developing examples from their resumes. While doing this, I’m reminded of small but critical items that are often times overlooked as individuals prepare for an interview. It is critical that you practice these little things in order to make you appear confident in your ability to succeed in the position and at the company. Here are 5 ways you can portray confidence during the interview.


**Use a Firm Handshake**

Practice your handshake with a friend or family member. What is their feedback? Is it the ‘limp fish’ weak handshake? Is it the ‘body builder’ crushing handshake? Is it somewhere in the middle – firm, but not too firm? Your handshake leaves an impression with the interviewers before you even open your mouth.


**Limit Use of Filler Words**

‘Um’, ‘Ah’, ‘Like’ . . . those little filler words add nothing to your answer. In fact, they are distracters that focus the interviewer on things other than the great example you just shared. First you need to identify your filler words. Videotape yourself practicing for an interview or practice with a friend as the interviewer. What are your filler words? You might be surprised by the words or phrases you rely on to fill the silence or use to stall while you think of an answer. It is very difficult to completely remove filler words from your answers during an interview. Fortunately, the more you practice, the easier it will be to remove those words from your answers.


**Choose Confident Wording**

Do you think you are the right person for the job? Or do you know you are the right person for the job. During interviews, many people become very modest. You do not want to appear arrogant, but if your wording demonstrates that you do not have confidence that you can do the job, why should the interviewer be confident about recommending you to be hired? Pay attention to the times you say “I think” or apologize during the interview for giving a poor example. Your choice of wording can be your worst enemy.

**Demonstrate Your Accomplishments**
During an interview, you will want to demonstrate that you are a good team player and have solid teamwork skills. However, if all of your examples focus on what your team accomplished and you don’t mention any individual contributions, you may leave the interviewer assuming you are unable to succeed at an individual level or be able to lead a team. Make sure the interviewer knows what you were able to accomplish individually in your prior roles.


**Make Eye Contact**

No one goes into an interview purposefully wanting to avoid eye contact. However, sometimes our eyes wander. Some people lose eye contact when they are thinking of an answer, when they are not confident in their answer, or when they feel they are staring at the interviewer. Breaking eye contact during the interview can make you appear less confident in your answers and ultimately in your fit for the position. While you practice for your interview, make sure you get feedback on your eye contact.

Add these five tips to your interview preparation and you will be well on your way to displaying confidence during your interviews.

I’m an intern who got a coveted spot at a clinical rotation. I’ve been there three weeks now and my preceptor has yet to say my name correctly. I was advised by an employee not to bring it up to her because I’m “just an intern.” What do I do?,24,ajx3tb,"I’m a dietetic intern. For those who don’t know about the field of dietetics, you need a dietetic internship (1200 hours, multiple rotations) to become a registered dietitian. Less than 50% of applicants get ANY internships, much less their top choice. I was accepted into an amazing program, and secured a rotation at a hospital only half an hour from me. I’m unpaid, and I will be at this site for five months. A clinical rotation is the hardest one to secure, so I was very fortunate to find ANY.

My name is not difficult to pronounce. It is said EXACTLY how it is spelled on my name tag that I am required to wear everywhere. However, my preceptor (the clinical dietitian in charge of me and my rotation) has yet to pronounce it correctly. I corrected her at least a dozen times during the first week, but was told not to discuss it with her further by one of the staff dietitians because it would be disrespectful and I’m “just an intern”. 

I don’t want to go through 5 months of my preceptor not caring enough to learn my name. She introduces me to other people incorrectly, and I don’t want to build my career under a name that’s pronounced wrong. She has been disrespectful and dismissive in other ways, but I’m so wary of saying anything that could lose me this spot in my internship. My internship director sympathizes with me, and says if I can find another clinical rotation I am welcome to change preceptors, but it took me weeks to secure this location and I can’t afford to waste time in this program. 

I have a degree. I’ve been to state, regional, and national honors conferences with my research. I am an intelligent woman and I take on any responsibility that is thrown at me. I feel like I at least deserve the respect of having my name said correctly by a woman who is supposedly mentoring me for my future career.

Am I overreacting? Should I say anything to her about the pronunciation of my name? If so, how?",2019-01-26 05:11:27

It's been two years since I graduated and I have nothing to show for it.. What do I do now?,23,a0vjnv,"Hi, Reddit.

I graduated with a bachelors of art in psychology (animal behavior focus) two years ago in May. In school I was high acheiving. I won a lot of awards, did well in all of my classes, was well liked and recommended to grad schools by all of my professors, etc. But in the end I only applied to 3 grad schools for specific programs and was rejected by all 3 for my gre score being only a couple of points below their threshhold.

Since I graduated, though, I have moved 3 times in two years, and have held a slew of restaurant/temp/seasonal jobs just to make ends meet, but most of them no longer than 6 or 7 months due to hours getting cut/moving/company getting sold. I have had 6 of these suckers since I graduated and it's embarassing. I'm constantly looking for a good job with a reputable company that utilizes my skills and degree, but I always get told I don't have ""experience"", I have even tried branching out from my desire to work with animals.

Passed over for a promotion - what next?,24,974nv9,"I’ve been at my current position for about 7 years now - have gotten great reviews each year and am viewed pretty highly (or so I thought). In my industry we tend to move folks around in my group every few years - a few months ago they essentially posted my exact job as a promotion with plans of moving me off my current role and a lateral move with no guarantees of promotion. I told them I would definitely prefer to remain in my role while getting promoted as opposed to a lateral role

Anyway I didn’t get my role, they gave it to an external hire and I’ve voiced my displeasure with the fact they are replacing me with someone at a higher salary level with just as much experience as me. I view the lateral move they have planned for me as a step back as there’s no clear next steps for me to a promotion and they want to lock me in for a few years (so if a new job posting came up they wouldn’t let me apply). My frustrations are coupled with the fact I’ve busted my ass the last few months in particular - and i feel like this whole situation is a slap in the  face. Yes the raise with the promotion would be nice but it’s just a respect thing that irks me.

Anyway I have weighed my options and was wondering if there is advice on how to best handle this. There is also the chance I get a promotion in my new role naturally but there are no guarantees. I want a plan and my group does not have one for me - how do I voice this and give myself the best chance to be promoted?

Is a law school degree or MBA better?,23,8rojdy,"Hello the People of Reddit,

I am desperately in need of inputs of any kind to the question of whether if I should pursue MBA or a law degree. 

To give a bit background about myself, I am a big4 accountant, licensed in Canada and US with a Master's degree in Accounting. I graduated when I was 21 and have been working for a year now. 

I have been thinking about my education and I am afraid that I have reached my peak. Do I just live with my degrees right now? Is this all I can do? Call me shallow if you will but I really think being a lawyer is very prestigious. But, I don't want to work longer hours than 50-70 hours a week. Being an accountant in Big4 is relatively busy with that hours but I can still have work life balance. I don't know if going to law school to get the education is good enough of a reason. Salary is never my end goals. I have no intention of working in Biglaw but I have to go through that route before I can work in house and have normal work hours. Being in law school will bring along a lot of skills and knowledge but at the same time, the cost of time is a burden. I am very fortunate to come from a relatively well-off family but I can always invest more with the tuition of law school.  

Should I go on to pursue an MBA to advance in business field instead? I am afraid that there will always be another degree to get. I don't know if I am considering law school because I hate my work right now and need a break from it.

What kind of job options are there for a man with a CS degree who doesnt enjoy CS?,23,8oc49t,"I realized in my third year of college that I didnt like my field. But my parents were paying for my college and I didnt feel like I could tell them. I finished college and found a software job right out of the gate. My job has further made me realize how much I dont enjoy the field. I think its because Im honestly not that good at it, just average. Passed college mostly taking the easy way out in every class.

I want to find a new job, but I dont know what I would like. I do know that Ive always wanted to help people, which is why I previously decided to take my degree and join the FBI later in life as a special agent.

"Beat down and defeated, how do you recover?",22,8mqw7x," I hate my current job so much I have become a husk of my former self. I have tried endlessly to find a new job that will be fulfilling or interesting. My 14 month search has yielded nothing however.

Sick of my office job. What's out there for a girl who wants to get her hands dirty?,22,89rfio,"(20F) I've been working in hospitality for about 3 years. I'm currently a supervisor on my way up to be a GM. After a lot of thinking and weighing pros and cons, I've decided I don't want an office job anymore. I want to be doing something physical. Using my hands, on my feet, ect.

I don't mind getting down and dirty when it comes to work. One of my first jobs was working on a farm. I cleared brush, built a small single studio apt (foundation, concrete, roofing, plumbing, decking, the whole 9 yards). I loved doing those things. I felt accomplished after every day of hard work.

I want to get into a apprenticeship and learn a trade. I'm thinking of an electrician, working for the DOT or DNR, as you get great benefits for working for the state.

I guess the point of this post is to ask you guys what you'd recommend for me. I'm a little intimidated being a somewhat young girl looking for a physical job, but I know this is what I want.

How do you thrive in a career with bad anxiety?,22,780tfr,"I start training for a new job tomorrow, and I am so excited.

"Unemployed since 10/15, at the end of my rope?",25,68wfu4,"I'm making this post because I honestly have no idea how to proceed in my life.

I went to a major state school with a good engineering program and graduated in Spring, 2013 with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering with a 2.7 GPA and no internship experience. I was able to get a job as an environmental consultant with a well-known firm with the idea that I would do that for a couple of years then try to transition into my target career as an engineer of some kind. As an air emissions specialist, I worked on-site at refineries across multiple states helping with emissions inventories and other reporting as well as permitting and computer modeling.

In August of 2015, I finished with a program with a major client that had the possibility of hiring me on with the client at the end of the program – and there weren't any openings for me. Back at our firm's office there weren't many projects for me as I'd been effectively gone for a year.

I finally got a good project after two months of basically twiddling my thumbs at work all day, and I fucked it up pretty badly. It had been 2+ years in this job and I knew I could use a couple of good co-workers and clients as references, so I knew that I was going to be looking for another job anyway. I procrastinated on the project I'd gotten thinking it was easier than it was and put my manager in an awful position – I really regret it and see now I should have either just quit or done the work. I told my primary manager (different person) about what had happened and that I'd be resigning. The next day I was let go. My primary manager, who I was on good terms with, told me that because I was otherwise in good standing that they wouldn't tell prospective employers that it was a termination. This was October, 2015.

I took two weeks off then started looking for entry-level engineering positions – and got nothing. Application after application after application, and no responses. I got discouraged and decided to put the job search on hold and do odd jobs for friends and family that needed help with various things. I traveled, spent a few months living with my grandparents while my grandmother recovered from surgery, and putzed about. At the time I was living with my parents then grandparents, so my expenses were minimal. This past October I started looking seriously for jobs again. I've expanded my search (to other environmental firms/positions and other industries), updated my resume infinite times, and reached out to recruiters, but time after time I still get no response or get sent an automated response saying I'm not qualified or that the position has been filled.

Now my parents have moved out to the country and my credit cards are nearly maxed. I'm approaching complete meltdown. I'm considering grad school, going for another Bachelor's, taking the FE exam, or getting otherwise certified as a technician or something. I'm attempting to pad my skills by learning PLC programming and Java/C++. I don't know what to do and feel completely worthless. I fucked up my chance at a good career I didn't want and now I don't have any career at all. I'd appreciate any advice & guidance, because otherwise it feels like the only place I can get hired now is Best Buy.",2017-05-03 01:38:26
How do you leave a comfortable position without much growth to pursue a career that is more rewarding but you have no experience in?,23,64u97n,"Pretty much title says it all.

ME: 28 years old, Live at home, making a decent living (in an extremely expensive market read: California) so no real expense to pay. Have a nice savings, PTO/health, etc.... no complaints right? First world problem...

But the thing is, I've been stuck at my current job (a biotech) for a good ~3.75years now. When I say stuck I mean I'm not learning anything, there's no advancement, I won't get fired because they need me but time is slow and there's not much to do (health insurance has owned us recently) and it's ultimately something I don't want to do nor do I see myself doing for more then a couple more months.

So what's preventing me from up and leaving? The simple answer is fear. I fear that my resume/skill level is not good enough to get into something I want to do (business development, analyst type job), and if I leave this position for a job that doesn't have the benefits mentioned or a position that is not fitting, then I'll be leaving for no reason. I have a bachelors degree in Business Science from a State University (forecasting, logistics, somewhat data-related) honestly nothing fancy bring home about but it's a degree. Factor in an interests in Database Analyst and some knowledge in SQL (self taught) and being relatively skilled in Excel (ie the basic to creating reports) I still want to pursue this route.

Yes, I don't sound like I'm all that confident in my ability. But I think it's because I haven't really searched for a job before on my own or all the positions I see online that tickles my interests have been like 2+ years of experience in a similar position or a lot of skills that I don't have. I know it's unrealistic to apply to a job where I don't expect to learn and be challenged (Because that's what I want to do!!! Be challenged and learn on the job while contributing to the company's bottom line)

This current job was handed to me by a friend who left to go back to school and as much as I enjoy being here or what I was doing for a while, I'm ultimately unhappy with where I'm at and definitely not content to stay here for much longer but it makes absolutely no sense just up and leave.

ramble ramble ramble.. my question is, have anyone been in similar position? Where everything is ""fine"" but you still want to get out but fear of making a big mistake? Sort of like a relationship where you get too comfortable but start having doubts.

How should I go about starting to push myself to enter a foreign territory that is down right frightening to me? (finding a new job).

Thanks! Hopefully I didn't break any rules.

"Please learn from my recent career mistake so it feels more useful, and maybe provide some feedback?",22,5k6pe7,"Hello Reddit. I've been a fan of Reddit for years, but I'm sitting on my couch losing my mind over a recent career mistake I made so I am finally making an account and spilling it out. Quite relieving, actually.

Like most other Engineering majors, I spent 4 years slaving away over books and working hard to make myself as impressive as possible to employers. As a computer engineer, I pretty quickly landed a job with a top defense contractor. After 6 months, things were going great. I wasn't thrilled with the job, though, probably just because I didn't realize the value of what I had. I applied for graduate school and was admitted to an Ivy, (albeit an online program), so that I could further my stopping power in the industry.

A few months passed, and I began losing the spark I used to have. I found myself becoming more of a ""hippie"" in a sense, saying that I'd rather be broke and do what I want than ""slave away in a cubicle for some dumb company"".

Oh, the grass is always greener on the other side :/ 

I quit my job, gave up the opportunity for the master's degree, became a personal trainer and began digging myself in credit card debt and losing lots of money as I tried to gain my footing in some new lifestyle.

Here I am 3 months after quitting, and I can say that I have never felt this level of regret before in my life. I will be getting back into my old field, (hopefully) and trying to get back on track. The problem is that for years I will likely be questioned for my stability as an employee, I may not get back into the Master's program I was in, and I have lost tons of money in the process, not to mention useful experience.

I told myself when I was quitting that this was the right decision, that I knew I'd never regret it. I'm not saying this is not true for some people, but honestly I really wish I would have listened to the people who were begging me to just wait it out and if I still felt this way in another year, than quit, especially after all that work.

So if you're thinking of quitting or throwing something away, that's normal! It might be the best decision.... But it might not. So give it some time, and please learn from my mistake so that my life experiences can be enriching to others and not for naught!

Well, that's my advice, now I guess I could use some advice from all of you on getting over this regret, keeping my head up and realizing that I am still in control of my career, although inevitably more behind than I had to be. I guess I could take my own advice on this one, but I like to be comforted by others, so give me a hand here.

Promotion accepted! Now I find out how lowball the offer I accepted was. How to I tell my boss this is unacceptable and I need to be compensated?,22,4dronm,"TL;DR:**Accepted new position as a Manager and found out my wage is 15-20k off**

I've been at my company or seven years in the same position.  My duties have grown over time and my roles changed but never received a new title(not important to me) but my compensation increased 150% over that time frame to match my duties and job performance.  
Anyway, I was recently promoted into a manager position for my department and I put down that I wanted $80k for the manager position as I was making $63k(hourly wage) after having my overtime cut over the last few years.  I felt the added responsibilities warranted that wage.  I was offered the new position at $68k salary.
Now, I am fairly open about my wage depending on who you are to me.  I went to my former boss (who is now an equal manager to me) and told him the offer I had accepted and after some prodding he thought it was really low.  He told me our new boss had told him to keep an ear out for me not being happy about the wage(this makes me think I was low-balled and they are open to pay more).  I discussed with a couple other managers who are soon retiring and they also thought my wage was off.  They even went on to give several examples of other people, not in manager positions, making in excess of $85k. I also find out a new position be posted that I know is already filled with someone who demanded $85k on a previous job offer and he was told this job would be coming and they would give it to him.

"23- never had a job, how to deal with huge gaps in your resume?",21,2p2r82,"Hi, I'll get right to it.
I graduated with my Bsc. in Psychology over a year ago. I never had a job when I was going to school because my parents wanted me to focus on school. 

Fucking dumbass idea, I realize now. I should have at least done summer jobs and internships but I honestly didn't know any better at the time.

I'm currently part-time in school doing a diploma in Fashion Management (it's something I really wanted to explore and I want to start my own retail business some day) but I still have no job.

I've been applying all year but despite being academically accomplished I can't even get entry level positions and internships that require no experience and just a basic secondary school education.

People tell me it's probably because employers know I won't stay in an entry position long so they don't want to bother to train me. I've applied to so many places with no luck I kind of just gave up after a while.

Anyway, the only job I had was a short stint as a sales clerk for 2 months at a clothing store. I wouldn't mind working in the mall again but the vast majority of mall jobs here go to till 7pm and that's when I have my evening classes..

Prospective Manager got really angry after I declined a job offer.,25,1vv8k0,"**tl;dr: I turn down a job offer in most professional way I know how. Prospective Manager gets pissed and shits on ALL the networking opportunities.**


So I got a call from a friend who's in my same field (IT) and leaving their job at their company, they asked for my resumé. ""Okay"", always answer when new opportunities knock. I told my friend right away I'm pretty happy at my current job but mo' money and career opportunities are always good.

Friend's manager calls me within a couple days, we set up an interview, great. The interview goes spectacularly and Manager really likes me. Manager asks for my salary requirements, I bump my current salary by 15% because that didn't seem too greedy. I could apparently do very well at this company but there's a few problems:

* A lot of cleanup to do since my friend didn't document their work very well. I realize this only once I tour the place.
* The commute would leave me in a really bad 3 hour lurch every day, I just signed a new lease. I give the commute three attempts on different days and it's horrible every time.
* Some workplace review sites have a dozen reviews from current and former employees, they all hate the place because of management, no reviews of my two-person department though.
* Reach out to some people who work there via Linkedin, THEY hate the place. Again, not my department.

I get an offer from manager and it's a perfectly good offer, surpassing my requirements.

I talk it over with my wife, she enjoys me coming home unstressed and on time. I talk it over with my friend, he's leaving for a better environment across the country. 

I write:

>Thank you, please give me a day or two to discuss this with my SO.

They write:

>Please keep in mind there are at least 3 other candidates out of 10 or so who have applied for the position who are ready to go at a moments notice. I'm just really impressed by your abilities.

I think, ""cool, whatever"" and write back saying that I understand. I take a day and make my decision, write back:

> Dear Manager,

> Thanks for the opportunity to meet with you to discuss this position. While your offer was more than adequate I feel as though I would not mesh with the culture of [Company] and that one of your other candidates may be a better fit. Please let me know if I can assist you with some upcoming projects because I was very impressed with you and your department...

Blah blah along the same vein, professional, courteous, timely, understanding. I don't want to burn this bridge as they may even be able to offer me a consultancy if they still want me RIGHT NOW. Manager is pissed, apparently he had to cash in some favors to get my offer that high, and once I decline because of the culture they're just mad. I get emails back demanding explanations and a call from them trying to bargain me, my friend is grilled over this person (me) they referred declining the offer. 

Prospective Manager wants to know how I know I wouldn't fit with the culture, I refer them to the reviews (mention nobody by name). They tell me none of that stuff matters to IT, but I know that stuff trickles all over the place when the executives are making people miserable (I don't mention this). I really liked this guy, I just didn't want to work for the organization.

Whole thing is bad. I feel bad because this manager person could've been a great contact, I feel bad because my friend is viewed negatively by his former boss. I didn't know the things that made me decline the job until during or after the interview so I was never knowingly wasting anybody's time.

How could I have managed this situation better? I burned a contact and my friend all because I tried to decline an offer gracefully.

"I'm lost... 26y/o techie with no degree, and need to get out of my dead-end job",24,1rrrsi,"I'm a 26 y/o who has no worthwhile college education.  I did go to college, for about a year, when I ran out of funding, and no way to continue (long story, but I needed a co-signer, and no one would).  For that, I just ended up with about $10K in student loan debt.

I am currently working full-time, as a security guard.  I've been doing it for the last several years, and it's something that's paid the bills (sorta).  I've got management experience (having managed around 20 employees, as well as all day-to-day operations for a fairly small franchised operation in my area).  Security has been the thing I've known best over the last few years, but I've been slowly hating it more and more over the last couple of years.  The mental and physical drain of the hours, the lack of sleep, the lack of virtually any social life.  It's time I moved on to something else.

The problem I'm having is that I just don't know where to go.  I'm a ""techie"" (you know, the one in the family that everyone goes to for ANYTHING tech-related).  I've been building computers since I was 10, I'm A+ Certified (as if it really means anything) and can fix/diagnose pretty much anything with a PC.  I did programming in High School (Basic, C++, Java) but it's been so long since I messed with any of that, I'd have to start over.  I'm also very well-versed with smartphones.  Be it iOS or Android, I know my way around there too.  I also designed and built a website from the ground up for the company my dad works for while I was a Senior in High School.

I just don't even know where to begin.  Programming and web design just make my head hurt when I even think about it.  Maybe it's overwhelming me and I'm over-thinking it.  Anything IT/computer ""repair"" related makes me think about all the idiots who click on random things and get viruses, which makes me want to strangle myself.  Anything iOS/Android related feels like it would be mostly confined to retail jobs within a carrier's store, for minimum wage.


I'd really like some help and feedback.  Any pointers and comments would be appreciated.  Thank you in advance, Reddit.  You guys/girls/robots are awesome.",2013-11-30 14:45:54
accepted job offer but got interview for another good job. advice?,23,bvgg3x,"I got a job offer from a hospital  in a database analyst role. **Good news:** Amazing manager, interviewed with him, seems like the nicest guy to work for. non volume based job as in there's still data to go through but nothing in a way where it is fast paced/high pressure. No paper filing/paper touching. I get to work at my own pace. It's more of a customer service job.

**Bad news:** still a 3-month contract. Not guaranteed whether it will get extended or turn full time. I am concerned about my future career outlook. I worked mostly contract jobs. First I was in banking now I am going to a hospital. I dont know how things went south with my career like this but this is my reality. I am just worried as to how this new job will help me get on a career path or is it just going to be another 3 month contract and then back to being unemployed?

**Feeling guilty:** After accepting this job offer, 2 days later I got interview request from a bank for executive administrative assistant position, 12 months contract. My immediate thought was that since I already accepted this hospital job hence I should decline the interview request so I declined it. But now I am feeling really guilty about it. I'm thinking I should have at least went to the interview. Would this have been a better job compared to the database analyst job at the hospital ? I've mostly worked at banks perhaps I should have just continued working in banking and make some career out of it? What if RBC had made me an offer and then how would I go about informing the hospital then that  I will not be working for them anymore as I found a job elsewhere? Would that me look bad in front of them?

Why does the universe keep throwing me in these difficult uncertain situations?

Sorry for the vent but I would really appreciate advice.",2019-06-01 06:14:49
Should there be some kind of index to gauge workplace toxicity?,22,bumo5v,"As I'm becoming more aware of mental health and how important it is to my own burnout, I’m channelling my energies into something that I’m a big believer in - compassionate and healthy workplaces. I've been thinking long and hard about healthy work environments for quite a few years now, as I haven't been involved with the most supportive people and haven't come across a mentor in years.

I'm wondering if many other people feel like they're not good enough, they don't get supported to grow, and this pressure to always be on just to meet the bare minimum of not getting fired?",2019-05-30 03:40:27
What are my options as a Journalism and Media studies graduate?,23,bs12qk,"I've just graduated with a 2:1 in Journalism with Media studies. I realised that I didn't want to be a journalist about halfway through my course but I had to still see it to the end rather than drop out and change courses. I have no real work experience but I have a blog that I've started up and been writing for. I like graphic design (not an expert by any means) and I've taught myself the basics of coding (HTML/CSS). I'm also able to use most Adobe creative cloud applications (Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Premier Pro). I'm very good with technology and social media and I would consider myself a fast learner. I would ideally want to work in a 'creative' field with eventually the chance to work mostly at home. But I know that's a long way off and right now I'm just looking for anything that's relevent to my interests. 

I've looked at job postings for copywriters, editors, marketing assistants etc. But so far any job I've found has required at least a year's worth of experience. 

I would just like to know if I have any other options to consider for a career? I don't mind working part time in retail or something similar for a year or so and teach myself another skill during that time.",2019-05-23 13:05:25
What's a good bachelor degree between Computer science and IT?,24,brplc4,"I'm so confused because I don't know that many difference of jobs I can get by getting either of these two degrees. Also, can you guys suggest me some good majors? I'm kinda scared of maths, even though I had math in High school. I can do math pretty decently, but I don't enjoy it at all.

I'm in marketing. How do I get out?,21,blvn3i,"I need some career advice here on what I can do to get out of my field. M24. I started college as a nursing major. I really wanted to help people, and I enjoyed what I did. However, I moved out of the house when I was 19, and started living with my now fiance several states away. As I began the second half of nursing school, the hours required simply weren't possible for me. I was working 52 hours a week at three different jobs to make sure we could pay bills, so once nursing required me being at campus on all weekends and have unpaid internships, I had to bail. I had a minor in public relations because I've always been decent at public speaking and writing, and once I dropped out of nursing I chose the communications major, and was able to finish it within a year. 

When I chose to step away from nursing, I was very worried that I would have a hard time getting a job. If you're an RN, you can get a job nearly immediately after graduation. For a communications major, it's not nearly as guaranteed. I applied to a million jobs, and ended up getting a marketing job in an insurance area. 

Here's the dilema I'm at right now. The company is growing at a very fast rate, and I was able to get in at a pretty good time. The marketing department is really me and my boss at the moment, but we have applications out for several other assistants. Within the past 8 months, I've worked very hard to get us caught up on all the big plans my boss and the COO of the company have, and have been promoted three times for doing a good job with what I'm tasked with. I've done email marketing, print design, event planning, any really anything else they've asked me to help with, including tech. I get along very well with my coworkers and bosses, they trust me and have talked quite a bit about how glad they are that I'm here and how much I will be rewarded for helping them grow — and I know they mean it. 

But I hate marketing. I'm a big believer in the phrase ""If you need to market it, it's because people don't need it."" I'm very against social media, but I'm the social media manager. We're a small business solutions provider, so all our content day after day is how we can make people more money. Everything is about money, and as someone who lives very simply and just focuses on basics in my life, it's very against what I actually believe and practice in my own life. I use a VPN so that other people in marketing can't track my IP. I use 5 different adblockers so that no ads can ever get to me. I avoid every ad that I can and do not use social media. I got through college without even having a cell phone because I don't agree with it. 

How the hell do I get out of this now? I hate saying that I feel an obligation to my workplace, but my coworkers and bosses have legitimately been very good to me and plan on using me to help their company grow. Were I to leave, they would be set back very far since I do a lot of tasks that I should honestly be paid more for, but haven't worked there long enough to have reflected in my paycheck. If they were to look to hire someone brand new for what I do, it would be a bigger price range. 

But outside of how I reconcile that to my coworkers, how do I actually get a job in another field? All I have for portfolio and resume materials is just marketing based. All my certifications, work accomplishments, and portfolio materials are based around marketing and graphic design. Neither of those are fields I am interested in pursuing. 

The other concern is money. I live in the Chicago area, and am recently engaged. My current position is 45k a year at entry level, and from what I can gather from my boss, my next promotion would put me somewhere between 55 and 60k. Money is not a big motivator for me, I generally put extras into saving, or usually donate a decent amount of it to charities that I support. However, I definitely couldn't take a pay cut without really affecting my fiance and me. I'm honestly at the point where I'm applying to garbage disposal positions that pay around that area, just so I can avoid the toxic wasteland of marketing. 

I apologize for the giant wall of text, but I'm just really not sure what to do and I don't know how to switch my entire career trajectory, but I definitely want to before it's too late.",2019-05-07 23:19:39

Got an Analyst job I'm Under Qualified for. Any advice on how to succeed in a challenging position?,21,bca7dm,"I landed a phone call with a hiring manager who ended up being an old IT manager of the project I was a PM of. He didn't bother interviewing me and basically gave me the position. I graduated college 3 months ago and have had about 1.5-2years of experience in analytical type roles. I will be starting in two weeks and the position is 2-3 years in advance of my current experience as well as focuses primarily on software I'm not extremely familiar with(SQL,Java, and Javascript). He was made aware that my Java experience was with school only. It's a 3 month contract position as an analyst for his team as someone is having surgery for 3 months(so I will be acting as a replacement), but he stated he would like to bring me on full time if this went well. He stated he really liked my attitude and work ethic and that's why he offered me an opportunity.

This job is well above my paygrade and I really want to succeed. I'm going in with the mentality of working extremely hard, first one in, last one out, while being open to feedback and learning. I'm just afraid that the lack of experience and lack of knowledge on these softwares/coding languages will really hold me back or make me seem like a fool.(I've never been a strong coder)

If anyone could provide advice on how I should approach this job, or any tools/tips, or share any similar experiences that would be great. I really want this opportunity to be a success and turn into a full time position.",2019-04-12 09:03:57
My employer royally screwed up my annual review. What is my recourse?,23,bbg2ke,"I work at a company where all the employees at my level are reviewed at the same time, which is now, in April. Basically, you get an overall score of either 1, 2, or 3, 3 being the best. The score informs both my annual raise amount, as well as an annual bonus I am eligible for. I sat down this past Friday for my review and much to my surprise, my review paperwork stated that I was being assigned a score of 1. Before I could balk at the score, my boss assured me it was in error and that my real score was a ""2"", which would be fixed shortly thereafter. At the end of my review she reviewed my raise & annual bonus information, which she assured me was in line with a score of 2.

&#x200B;

After she had left on Friday, I looked up my bonus program online and noticed that I had been given a bonus for a 1, not a 2 as she had assured me. I sent this information to her via email and she sat me back down again on Monday.

&#x200B;

On Monday she apologized and told me that when she went to fix the error, she was ""reminded"" by our district manager that a 1 was actually the correct score. She apparently had forgotten because her original intention was to give me a 2, but the DM talked her into giving me a 1. Naturally I was pretty upset. After taking some time to digest the information and think through my options, I sat back down with her later that day and let her know it was unacceptable to me to have been given the incorrect information, rightly or wrongly, & that the feedback I had been given over the last year did not lead me to believe I had deserved a 1, or anything close to it. I felt betrayed and blindsided. Since it seemed like the DM had informed the score, I asked to be re-reviewed by her and the DM so that I could get an explanation of the score and a more sincere apology for messing up the process so badly to begin with.

&#x200B;

The DM is currently on vacation this week but it looks as though I'll have a chance to meet with her next week. What should be my course of action moving forward? I feel as though the score is something I'm stuck with, mistake or not, but I'd like to know what you all think I should bring into next week's meeting.",2019-04-10 04:17:47
How to get around degree requirements?,24,b94xh5,"So I'm writing this about my husband. He's a software engineer, and forgive me for bragging about him, but he's brilliant at it. Hired right out of high school, and that's now become an issue. He has 25 years' worth of experience but no degree. He's grown dissatisfied with his employer and wants to leave, but all the job postings say degree required. He's in defense contracting now which is a huge industry in our city, so his skills would transition easily.

My concern is that with all the automatic screening employers do, if he fills out an application online and indicates he doesn't have a degree, he'll be rejected without anyone even reading his resume and seeing what a wealth of experience he has. Does anyone ever look at the reject pile, are there certain keywords he can put on his resume, can he bug people on LinkedIn? He's pretty introverted so he doesn't have a huge network to draw from. Or does he need to suck it up and get a degree? ",2019-04-04 01:53:38
I don’t know how to get out of my current career path. I hate the line of work I’m in. How do I change? What am I suited for with my degree/experience/skills?,23,b5aslp,"I’m 25 years old, BS in psychology, worked in the field of social work (need I say more?) for 5 years and realized I hate it. Even started my master’s, which only helped me realize this field sucks. I want to help people but the bureaucracy is disgusting. Working my ass off for nothing, living paycheck to paycheck, ridiculous OT, unrealistic expectations, I hardly have energy for the people I love because I’ve given it all away to a job that exploits its workers and its clients. Most people in social work have to work multiple jobs, nights and weekends, just to make decent money. I don’t want that, my passion for the field no longer overrides the difficulties of it. I’m officially burnt out, I even called out today because I just couldn’t stand to go in and wanted to devote my day to some career research.

I want to get out. I just don’t know where to start. I’m a people person, I love to help people, but I don’t want to go into the healthcare field anymore and people exhaust me, even though I’m good at interacting with others. I have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and many people who know me think I would do well in communications or marketing. I don’t really want to go into sales though. I learn quickly, especially anything tech or computer-related. I’m well-versed in health insurance policies and tend to pick up on the lingo and finer points of insurance very quickly. I’m willing to go back to school for something I like if a company would help me out with it financially. I make around $40k per year and can’t afford to take a pay cut, so I’m not sure where that leaves me with my options.

What jobs would suit me? What should I even be looking for? This is gonna sound corny, but I feel lost. Quarter life crisis maybe? Lol.

[Rant] How to deal with rude interviewers?,21,auufqs,"The majority (~80%) of my interviews are pleasant and normal, but I've had a series of rude interviewers lately, and I'm wondering how you guys deal with them. 

Some context: Last week, I sat through a 2nd round with 3 of the worst interviewers, all from the same company and team. The 1st guy was completely unprepared and disengaged, and actually read my resume to me. The 2nd made jabs at my current company and my college. He was hostile in general and had no manners. In the middle, he took off his shoes and said inappropriate things about the person who left this role. 

The 3rd fired finance question after finance question for a tech job, followed by 10 or so brainteasers. I got mildly fed up and directly asked him what this had to do with the role, to which he couldn't answer. All of them couldn't tell me what it is they actually do and they didn't seem interested in their work. Despite feeling worn out, I still answered their questions as best I could and figured out many of the brainteasers. 

Having first done a phone screening with the hiring manager, who is knowledgeable and personable, I was excited for this role but after talking to these 3, I had no interest left in working there. This morning, I get a call from the recruiter saying that the hiring manager would like to extend an offer, but I turned him down and thanked him for his time. Apparently, the recruiter is hearing similar feedback from other candidates.

On the bright side, this was a blessing in disguise. I'm glad they showed their true colors to me. This would have been a strange, dysfunctional team. I also don't understand how they let people who have zero communication skills do interviews. And what's the deal with brainteasers? Guesstimating how many golf balls fit on a plane and how to pour water into jugs will not help them with their poor code and outdated app. 

Anyways, I got really close to getting up and walking out after the interview with the 2nd guy, an angry dudebro. He talked down to me the entire time and I even told him he was being negative. Have any of you confronted a rude interviewer, or just straight up walked out of an interview?",2019-02-26 05:30:06
