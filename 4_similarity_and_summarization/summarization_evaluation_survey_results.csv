What does a data scientist do?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.

 


	The definition of this newfangled title ""data scientist"" is basically a super-awesome statistician, with a variety of skills and experience to match (I see the title as a senior title, and have seen it at the C-level). Since you can apply statistics to a wide variety of information, this title would be transportable across a variety of industries where extracting information from large amount of structured or unstructured data (aka ""big data"") is useful, such as pharmaceutical, network security, defense/intelligence, medical, financial, government... If you're interested in quantitative analysis of the financial markets, my suggestion is to start working on a model. In fact, a financial quant I used to work with spent his free time working on a football (aka soccer) player performance prediction system, while I (as a network engineer), spent very little time looking at utilizing simple stats to extract data out of network traffic. You can use these examples of your expertise during an interview.
	Data scientists in a product-oriented organization (think about companies like Airbnb/Uber/Facebook) are there to build better products. They make it happen through 1) aiding better decision making 2) participating in building data-powered product. For 1) data scientists perform quantitative analyses, build dashboards and run experiments. For 2) data scientists design and implement algorithm-based, automated solutions that are typically consumer facing
	. Hi Flora! Data Scientist title is often used to describe jobs that vary drastically. Depending on the company and amount of data they have, it could mean pure Data Analysis where the person extracts data from a data store/warehouse and creates meaningful visualization and aggregation on top of that data. This branch answers questions around operational reporting of data. It could on the other hand mean utilizing more sophisticated statistical and machine learning methodologies to extract patterns out of data and do predictive science based not that. This requires a formal degree in Maths, Statistics, Physics or a similar discipline. This branch is more focused on creating data driven products. Hope this helps and God Luck!
	In my view, Data scientist job is beyond big data/data mining/statistics/programming skills. A data scientist should be these qualities to be successful in any industry: Hope this clarifies your question.Data scientist means a lot of things, but in general I can say the role includes a lot of working with data to do something useful. In some cases, such as in my job, it might be to answer questions nobody else has answers to, in business speak referred to as ""drawing insights"". In some cases, the purpose is to build algorithms to predict things. I notice you have posted a few other questions about finance, and I think in this field the predictive analytics might be most relevant. The basic requirement for a data scientist is to be good at quantitative analysis. Make sure you are taking math and economics classes, and it might even be helpful to learn some programming software such as Stata, R, SPSS, mySQL, Python etc.
	Hello Chong G. I am not a data scientist, but I think I can give you some advice on this. Nowadays, an increasing number of professions are requiring analytics capabilities. There are some core things you should learn to handle great amount of data, like: åÊ Relational Database concepts; SQL - Computer language for creating and managing databases; Excel; Programing languages such as C, VBA, R...åÊ You should also consider learning how to display the data in an organized way and Power BI / Think-Cell are great for that There are several tutorials around the internet about those topics and also focused courses. I personally recommend the latter, because it is easier to progress through the topics. Hope my advice was helpful to you!
	You should search for Algorithm videos. Usually when studying data, you would need to know about databases structure, analytics skills, and some other logics. Another thing you could do would be start analyzing some small real cases like how long does it take to go from your house to the supermarket and what you could do to reduce the time? or how often do you drink water (time gap between each occurence). How could you track that? and how could you improve it? is it good? these are a few examples on how you could analyze stuff.

How long do I need to study to become a surgeon?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	Although open heart surgeons generally make a very respectable income regardless of their location (average U.S. income over $500,000) the average salary of an open heart surgeon can vary from state to state and is partially based on how many operations and types of operations a surgeon performs within a given year. https://www.neurosurgeonsalarylife.com Check the link below. https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-steps-of-becoming-a-doctor-in-India 
	I can't say personally what it's like but my dad is a surgeon so I have a family perspective. First, the hours are long and you're spread all over the place. Depending on what kind of surgeon you are, you'll need to work at a hospital or surgery center for some of the big stuff. Patients meet the doctor in an office space normally, to determine if surgery is needed or if some other form of treatment is better. This looks and feels like any doctor's office you've been to. If you need to perform surgery, then you head to a hospital or surgery center. Hospitals have full staff, big and expensive imaging devices, emergency care, all the major medical stuff. To work at a hospital, typically you need to agree to be on call. This means that on certain weekends or evenings, you'll need to have a phone near you and be ready and able (aka, nearby and sober) to visit patients. These are the doctors that you'll see on hand at night at the Emergency Room. This means as a doctor, there's a lot of time you'll be unavailable to hang out with friends or family. It's scheduled in advance, so you'll be able to make plans, but it can be hard for people outside your field to understand and work with you. Surgery centers are not 24 hour operations, so I don't think there is an on call schedule. But they aren't fully equipped and staffed for major operations so it doesn't work for all surgeons. However, the reduced options mean reduced costs, so they are often great options for doctors and patients to save money. Many doctors work both in surgery centers as well as hospitals to get the bets of both worlds. Second, there's a lot of continued education. You need to be certified to practice. Your college education is not certification, it's prep for it. Once certified, you need to renew. Renewing means you need to attend special classes or conferences that go over some of the latest advancements in your field. This keeps your skills up to date and relevant. Usually there's travel involved, which you can write off for taxes since these are required for your business. I remember going to Boston and Salt Lake City with my parents as a small kid, staying with a nanny while my parents attended a conference and seeing the city after it ended. It's not all work, but if you aren't up to the commitment, you'll lose your licence. There are of course other requirements for renewal but I didn't see or deal with them as a family member. Last, there's a lot of background costs you might not realize that will influence your working life. Malpractice lawsuits are always a possibility, so you need insurance for that. Some of the equipment, like x-ray machines, are incredibly expensive. Plus, you'll need to have staff to handle billing, scheduling, and probably a medical assistant (MA). This is why medical costs are so high, individual doctor's offices are full blown businesses where multiple people are following their own career paths and it all orbits the doctors. If you're business savvy, or want freedom to make your own decisions and don't mind the extra time and costs, you have a private practice for your office. You'll likely still need access to hospital space for surgeries, so you'll likely still have an on call schedule. These days however, the costs of running the business side of doctors' offices are so high and time consuming that doctors will often join group practices. This allows for shared resources and support personnel. It's a lot to think about. If you love the idea of practicing medicine, there's LOTS of options. From nursing, to elderly care, family doctors, surgeons, physical therapists, and emergency responders - no matter where your talents lie, there's an option. Shoot for the option that you are not only interested in, but have aptitude for. A surgeon that barfs at the sight of blood or a nurse with no empathy are going to have short careers. Pick the one you want to be the best at, and go for it. :)
	I would think at least 8 years. Medical School is where you complete the degree work to become a doctor, the residency portion is where you decide what type of doctor you want to be an specialize in that. The pre-requisite for medical school is any undergraduage degree. Some lean towards biology, chemistry or health sciences - but any will do. It's the MCAT that gets you end. 
	The first 4 steps as I understand them: Step 1: Earn a Bachelor's Degree. ... Step 2: Take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) ... Step 3: Earn a Medical Degree. ... Step 4: Complete a Residency Program. ... Well Rachel you don't really study surgery in college. The path to becoming a surgeon looks like this. You attend college for 4 years, then 4 years of medical school and them you do what is called a surgery residency, where under the supervision of more experienced surgeons you become a surgeon, after you are already a doctor. So what you are really asking is what is a good pre-medical college. The answer is that you can get into medical school from most colleges as long as you have good grades and otherwise do well. You should pick a college where you are most comfortable. It is helpful if it has a strong science program because although you do not have to major in science to be admitted to medical school, you must take a number of science courses at the very least, and many individuals do choice to major in a science. ( Something related to biology, chemistry, physics, etc) This still should give you a very broad choice. Good luck!

What are career options for an art major?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	Depending on what type of artist you want to be will determine what track you follow as an artist. What do you like? What medium do you like to work in? What inspires you? What art field have you seen that excites you? Whatever the answers are to these personal questions might help you decide what track to pursue as you work your way to college. The simplest answer though is just do it. Just draw, paint, design... Just do it now and keep doing it every day and then when you're in college do it some more. You become the artist you want to be by just doing what you're passionate about. Once you hone your skills, learn, practice, understand and continue to improve you'll begin to find your place and the career that works for you. 
	Check out the website in the suggested steps section, it is a nice list of art and art related jobs.
	Your question has merit however the term artist is far too broad to give any kind of definitive advice. The arts is such a broad field and each type of artist has to plan based upon their kind of art they produce eg. a illustrator for children's books as opposed to an artist who produces illustrations for medical anatomy publications.
	Hi Azra, I think it's worthwhile to explore what kind of art you'd like to pursue. Do you want to be a fine artist and sell paintings in galleries, or make sculptures? Or maybe work in the entertainment industry creating concept art or matte paintings for games or films? The art world is very broad, but my advice is to explore different types of art, find what you enjoy most, and try to learn about that more in depth! Don't be scared to try new things, you may be surprised by what you like once you try it out. 
	The first step is to determine how your personality is related to those in the meteorology field and then to meet and talk to people who are doing what you think that you might want to do based on the testing to see what they do, how they got there, and what advice that they might have for you. Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear. Following are some important steps which I developed during my career which have been helpful to many . 
	Back when I went to college, outside activities were not as important as they may be today. I also did not start with art school as I was unsure of my abilities and had no idea what I wanted to do with my future. I went to a liberal arts college and minored in art with a major in English. I then decided I wanted to be an artist and went to art school taking art classes only (I believe in undergraduate art school you still have to take math, english, history etc. in order to graduate - that was covered at the liberal arts college) in order to get into graduate school. I graduated with an MFA in 1977. In all cases regarding art school, the main emphasis was what the admissions folks thought about my portfolio. It is my feeling that you will be accepted for your artistic ability, your original creativity, and your knowledge and usage of art materials and tools. Since your outside activities all have to do with art, I'm sure they will be taken into consideration, but the bottom line (especially regarding graduate school) is your body of work. I hope this helps and best wishes for an artistic future.
	Hey Danielle, I work a lot with UX folks. Motion designers typically make the same as any other type of designer in the same focus (interaction design, visual designer, etc.) To be the most valuable, and employe-able, I would recommend focusing on mulit-modal product design. A lot of motion designers focus on websites, graphic design, or marketing. Motion designers in the highest demand are the ones working on tangible, consumer products. Generally, motion design is a more niche skill set, and fewer roles exist out there. That means working really hard to grow your portfolio, network and skills is very important. If you work really hard and become very good at anything, you will make a lot of money. Alternatively, Interaction design is a SUPER in demand skill right now. If you prefer something more technical, front-end engineering or UX engineering are also very in demand right now. To answer the original question. You can use sites like Glassdoor to get a general idea of income. Companies typically consider design roles on the ""technical"" ladder, which means they pay well comparatively. Hi, I would suggest going to Google and looking for salary amounts in your city, state with this job title.

What should I study in college if I want to be a pilot?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	The initial investment required to become a commercial pilot is, on average, north of $100,000. That's a major hurdle that you'll have to overcome right off the bat. These days, a lot of pilots are starting their careers beneath a mountain of debt. I was able to avoid that because I'm a veteran, and was able to put my GI Bill benefits to use. Salaries start low in aviation - in the mid-$20K range - but can go very high - north of $250K for captains with a lot of seniority at a major airline. It takes years to get to that point, though. At airlines, typically, you'll be quoted an hourly rate that sounds high, but that's only for actual flight time - all the other time you spend doing your job is technically unpaid. Most airlines guarantee a minimum number of flight hours per month, so you are essentially being paid a base salary. For example, $45/hr x minimum 60 hours per month = approximately $32K per year. If you fly more than that, of course, you'll be paid more. The company, however, will do what they can to limit such ""overtime"" on your part. Some jobs will also have per diem pay and flight benefits, which are fun to use with your family. 
	Avoid limiting your sights to the airlines. There are myriad opportunities you can pursue as a commercial pilot that have nothing to do with flying for an airline. Most of my flying is air ambulance operations. You can tow banners, haul cargo, do aerial photography/survey, agricultural spraying, firefighting, law enforcement, or teach others to fly as an instructor. The salary ladder in aviation is a long one to climb, and you need to be in it because you love flying, or you'll probably have a hard time summoning the motivation to put up with some of this career's pitfalls. It's certainly not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you care about maximizing the return on your educational investment, it may not be a wise choice - but if you love flying, you won't be able to imagine doing anything else.Glassdoor.com gives the salary ranges for positions and you can even limit the data to geographical location.
	Hi, Here is a good link with some information about being a pilot...you can make good money but it will take you time to learn, log flight hours and gain experience with smaller aircraft and you may not make a lot of money initially. It will take time...if you are really interested, it is a great career...I am not a pilot but I have pilots in my family. If you are in it for just the money, I would suggest rethinking your career options. Pilots work a lot of hours, are gone for long periods of time and spend a lot of time sleeping at airports. Good luck!
	http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/modern/pilot2.htm 
	If you're going to college and you know you want to be a pilot, you should go to a school that has a flight program. There are many out schools out there including community colleges and public and private universities. You don't have to have a college degree to become a pilot but most of the major airlines won't hire you without a college degree.Personally I attended a four year university that had a flight program all in one. 
	There are multiple paths to becoming a pilot, one of them is to attend a university that allows you to fly at the same time you obtain your degree. Other paths include the military where a person obtains their college degree before becoming an officer. Once the person is an officer in the military they are able to go to flight school.You do not have to have a 4 year degree to be a pilot. You can obtain a pilots license from local training programs likely at your local airport. However, most airlines do prefer a degree. There are college programs specifically geared toward careers in aviation that include your ratings and offered offer a time building Oporto out through instructing. As for military, you do need a four year degree to becom an Officer. Army Warrant Officers are not required to have a degree but a some college or at least a two year degree will make you more competitive in the application process.

Does playing sports in college help you find a job?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	Hi Michela! As a former college athlete, I strongly encourage you to participate in sports while in college for many reasons, listed below. But like all things, it will only distract your from your grades and studies if you let it. Too much of anything will take you away from your studies, like partying, sleeping, working, etc. Its about finding life balance, and knowing your limits. But I highly suggest you get involved (or stay involved) with sports in college, and here is why: So go out there and give it your best! You can do it!
	Hey David! I have to say that working in rehabilitation is awesome career. I think you'll really like it. Here's a short answer to your question: (PT) Physical Therapists go to SEVEN years of school: 4 years for a general BS + 3 years for a Doctorate in Physical Therapy (PTA) Physical Therapist Assistants go to TWO years of school: 2 years for an Associate's in Physical Therapy (AT) Athletic Trainers go to FOUR or SIX years of school: currently, it only requires a bachelor's in Athletic Training but anyone who starts school in 2022 or later must complete a general BS + 2 years for a Master's in Athletic Training. All three careers have a lot in common, and you probably worked with all three at different times (which is where you might have mixed up the term physical trainer.) Generally, ATs are the people who travel with sports teams and sit court side to help immediately with injuries, PTs/PTAs are more likely to work in a clinic/hospital and treat athletes after a severe injury or orthopedic surgery. Here's more info on each: https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physical-therapists.htm https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physical-therapist-assistants-and-aides.htm https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/athletic-trainers.htm Let me know if I can answer any questions from those webpages! Best of luck, Brendon 
	In short - Statistics and Sports Management. Many sports franchises and colleges have statisticians to help coordinate game data and analysis. 
	Hi Betsy! This is a great question. I myself was a Division 1 athlete in college and would have to say that it was one of the most rewarding experiences. My college experience was very different from others who did not play sports, there were sacrifices I made to keep up with my academics and athletics. But one of the greatest skills I learned during my time as an athlete, was time management. When it comes to academics, you will learn how to prioritize your work loan and meet deadlines. Your athletics obligations consist of practice, games, conditioning, lifting, and coaches meetings. Though it was challenging, it was rewarding in that I had the opportunity to play a sport that I loved, at a very competitive level, while also getting my education. Everything is manageable, and I wish you all the best of luck! Here are some good tips on balancing life in college. Good balance will allow your to do what you want to do, play sports, and have time for getting good grades. ## https://www.unigo.com/in-college/college-experience/creating-a-workschool-balance-a-college-student-perspective http://www.mycollegesuccessstory.com/academic-success-tools/college-life-balance.html http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/000241/
	Not really, you just have to find a good balance between your studies and sport. If you really want to play sports then don't take like four or five classes a semester because you won't be able to do well. Maybe take less classes where you have time to do your class work and the sport you want. Overall, make sure you are able to balance your time.

I have been a legal secretary for five years. What are my next career options?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	Life is as much about figuring out what you don't want to do that will lead you down a path of what you do and do not enjoy, what you are and are not passionate about. Make a decision after you experience the internship.I agree with all the answers above. Internships are incredibly helpful. I'd encourage you to try the internship and be open to learning as much as you can while you are there. At the very least, you'll know more about what interests and inspires you. 
	Like Jenna said, make sure you understand what is expected of you while you are there. Also, be clear about your schedule and when you can/can't be there. While you're there, ask questions and be as curious about the day-to-day as you are about the exciting meetings, court appearances, etc. That will help you get a well-rounded sense of the job. I agree- internships are awesome ways to learn what you do and do not like about a particular field. You will not be forced to go into a career as a result, but it's a good way to get some exposure. I would make sure you are clear on the expectations for dress code, attendance, duties you will/will not be expected to perform, and if you will or will not be paid, and what you would like to get out of the experience. Do you want to go to court, work on a negotiation, prepare a document, etc.? If you go in with some specific goals, then you will have something to work toward, and that might help your confidence level as well.
	Justaney, Abby's answer nailed it! This is an opportunity that should not be passed up. You will learn not only about law, but also about yourself. If you are seriously contemplating law, the thought of an internship might scare you away? Why? Because the role is glorified by the entertainment industry. Every job there is has both good and bad aspects, and knowing both sides can help you make the right decisions. However, if you do it and it is a bad experience, does not necessarily mean it is not for you. There is a lot of difference from one office to the next. Anyway, just give it a try! I bet you have fun! Kim Janell, To become a consultant, you will have to develop a reputation for being accurate in your assessments. I think you should get involved in politics at the ground level - work on voter registration drives, join campaigns, etc., go to political functions. Much of politics is about networking. As to schooling, consultants tend to work with statistics, so I think you should gain a solid understanding of statistics. Beyond that, I'm not sure which way to go. There seems to be an element of marketing, and communications, tied to this position. I don't know if anyone offers a particular major in it. If not, you will need to design your own! Try to find successful political consultants in your area, and see if they will be willing to talk with you. Sorry I was not of more help. Hopefully this has helped a little. Best of luck! Kim 
	PS (for David) I have not done much since retiring. I'm not truly a social person, and networking is extremely difficult for me. In my college days, I managed to get involved in party politics at the local level, getting selected to go to the senatorial convention from my local neighborhood precinct. I did block-walking and phone banks, and even painted banners for the convention (I doubt they do that anymore!) We formed a ""Young Democrats"" club on campus, and invited candidates to speak. We gathered signatures to help candidates get on the ballot. Once I became an officer, I used my knowledge and experience to help the police association, securing pay increases, training, and other things to improve morale and professionalism. Our little group (50 officers) went up against national unions who were trying to be the sole voice of employees. And prevailed! I really have not interacted much with consultants - I'm more of a sideline observer! It's possible I misunderstood the question. I was thinking about campaign consultants. There is a whole different aspect, which would be more along the line of advisors. A possible position here would be the US Foreign Service, working at the embassies. It's extremely competitive to get in. The entrance exam is difficult. Somehow I failed the English section, even though I was an A/B student and did well on the ACT and GRE. If that is the direction you are going, I would strongly recommend learning grammar! It also tests your knowledge of world history, arts, culture, etc. Whatever direction you are going, I would strongly encourage you to keep current in your technological skills and use of social media! Kim
	The educational requirements for legal advisors are equal to those of lawyers and attorneys. Before attending law school, legal advisors typically earn a bachelor's degree in pre-law or a comparable discipline. After graduating, potential legal advisors are required to take and pass the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and enroll in a law school that is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). In total, lawyers can expect to be in school for about seven years after high school. Some legal advisors may choose to go on to graduate school and receive a master's degree in a law-related discipline, such as a Master of Laws (LLM). Legal advisors are required to have passed the bar after graduating from law school. Additionally, they must attain licensure from their state before advising on legal matters. Some states also require legal workers to pass an ethics exam prior to practicing law. Additionally, legal advisors must hone communication and negotiation skills. Strong judgments skills are also a necessity, and legal advisors must be prepared to make ethical and moral decisions.

	Computer programmer it's a highly technical occupation defined by the department of labor as ""write and test code that allows computer applications and software programs to function properly. They turn the program designs created by software developers and engineers into instructions that a computer can follow"". Employment of computer programmers is projected to decline 7 percent from 2016 to 2026. Computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, so companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower. You can find more info here: https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm 
	I recommend you to think if you'd rather be a Software Developer, that's a little bit more high-level occupation. Defined as ""the creative minds behind computer programs. Some develop the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on a computer or another device. Others develop the underlying systems that run the devices or that control networks"". This is the most requested profession right now in Silicon Valley, and it's very well paid. Employment of software developers is projected to grow 24 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Software developers will be needed to respond to an increased demand for computer software. (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) 
	You actually identify two somewhat separate areas. ""Creating programs"" is a common job for a software engineer, and it requires understanding of programming, the ability to improve an existing program to add features that are needed or wanted, and often working with others to plan who will do what parts. Researching the latest computer theory can be involved in writing new programs, but often lies in a different direction. Most new programs aren't using the latest, most advanced computer science, but rather are combining old, existing ideas in useful new ways. Researchers tend to be like what Lionel Silberman said, with advanced degrees. They often, but not always, focus more on the theory and let other people, several years later, write the programs using the theories they made. There are a few jobs which combine the two. Google was famously founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who came up with a new idea of what was possible with the Internet, and made a company around it. This kind of innovation is very difficult, but can be incredibly rewarding. 
	A possible path for you would be to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and during that time work on some practical programming, whether personal projects, contributing to an Open Source project, or interning with a software company. Between that and the degree, you can try to figure out which one you prefer, creating practical programs or delving deeply into advanced theory. Then you can decide whether you want to go into the industry, stay in academia, or a mix (some people get Masters degrees in Computer Science and then try to find a job with a company that will innovate and use the newest ideas).Software engineering is a fast-growing occupation with a high salary potential. From computer operating systems to video games, many of the products we rely upon today are supported by software. Software engineers specialize in either computer software applications or computer software systems. They analyze users‰Ûª needs and then design, test, and develop software by applying the theories and principles of computer science and mathematical analysis. 
	Computers and information technology play a prominent role in our daily lives and in the business world, so there is a constant need to develop new software. Software Engineer Education Degree Requirements Depending on the employer, software engineer education degree requirements range from an associate‰Ûªs degree to a master‰Ûªs degree. An associate‰Ûªs degree might be sufficient for some entry-level positions, but a bachelor‰Ûªs degree is required for most software engineering jobs, while more complex jobs might require a master‰Ûªs degree. Employers place a high value on relevant experience, so it is recommended that you participate in internships while pursuing your degree. Aspiring software engineers usually major in computer science, computer information systems, software engineering or mathematics. Some students take programming and software engineering classes to supplement a degree in another field, such as accounting, business or finance. You can also pursue relevant certifications offered by software vendors and training institutions. 
	Software engineers must have strong problem-solving and communication skills and an aptitude for math and science. They should also possess good programming capability; an in-depth knowledge of programming languages, like C++, C#, and Java; an attention to detail; and an ability to handle multiple tasks at once. Becoming a Software Engineer: Career Outlook Software engineers are involved in all aspects of software creation, from writing code to debugging programs to overseeing the launch of new software. They often start out writing code but eventually advance to senior positions, working as software architects or project managers. In a software engineer career, it‰Ûªs essential to keep up with the latest advancements, because technology is constantly evolving. Having strong interpersonal and management skills is also crucial since software engineers often collaborate with marketing, manufacturing, and design professionals in creating new software. 
	Job opportunities for software engineers are expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall employment of computer software developers is expected to increase by 30% percent from 2010 to 2020. The demand for software engineers is increasing because of the Internet‰Ûªs expansion and the growing complexity of data-processing systems used in business, telecommunications, healthcare, and government. Some worry that offshore outsourcing may put a damper on employment growth for software engineers, but there will still likely be a need for skilled software developers domestically, because the job requires significant research, development, and innovation.This is a broad topic and you will have to narrow down your focus. If for example you are interested in database programming then you can get books on what is a database, how to design and build one. You can search online to find trade magazines and conferences that have articles or papers on the latest design trends and innovation in database design working on things like security, reliability, speed etc.To be on the cutting edge, requires an advanced degree to understand the theory. As much schooling as you can afford and of course constant out-of-school learning. The most attractive candidates are those that combine schooling with hands-on work, perhaps as a grad student, working for a professor on the cutting edge.

What is most important on a resume or CV when applying to tech companies?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	keeping your rÌ©sumÌ© and profiles updated covers your flanks in a handful of ways: In the event of an unexpected job loss, it means you can immediately start hunting for a new position. It makes you look like even more of an awesome candidate to recruiters and prospective employers who might be lurking around the Internet. It keeps colleagues appraised of your skills, which is particularly useful if you‰Ûªre the type who takes on freelancing work on a regular basis.
	Hi Ligaya, You can update your resume once in a yr with all the initiatives, skills added and promotions that you got. All the best.Whether you're looking for your first job, a better mid-career opportunity, or are ... freshening your resume, update as often as you canevery 6 months along with experience and learningI would recommend every 12 months and make sure that the initiatives and skill sets achieved during that specific time are mentioned 
	Your Resume needs to be updated atleast every six months with the new achievements and skill set you have. It is best if you to use the 10 year suggestion. It is usually not necessary to go beyond that. After saying that there are certain reason whys someone will put in a job experience when it has been longer than 10 years; here are some of those reasons: 1. If you have gaps in your work experience for various reasons you might want to put a job that you did 12 years ago under your job experience especially, when the job you did is comparable to the job that you are applying for. 2. Another reason is if you have a side business or job and have been doing it a long time you might want that in your experience section to show that you are competent and have other experience, especially if this experience can help you get the job. 3. Another reason would be if you had been caring for a loved one such as mom, dad, sibling, grand parent etc, and were not working for a certain amount of time, you can explain that gap by putting it down as a caregiver and put down dates you were caring for them, and that would explain some of the working experience gaps and explain all the duties that you did as a caregiver. 4. Another reason is if you had gone back to school or worked on an internship for a couple of years, and you learned many things and got experience with the internship those might be reasons to go back a few years before the school or internship especially if it is pertaining to the jobs you are looking for. and explain what you did on that internship or job. 5. There is one other way you can set up your resume: Under the Experience Section you can also have a Previous Experience Section: This gives the reader a chance to see what other jobs you have done. I would not really advise this unless you don't have enough experience under the experience section. At least two or three jobs to show the reader you might be a good candidate. I hope this helps. A book on resumes will help answer some questions. I hope I understood correctly what you wanted to know, and please let me know if you have any other questions. I wish you the best! 
	In my professional experience, a good resume should be no longer than 2 pages. Professional experience, or employment should reflect the last 10 years. Use key words and bullet points to highlight experience. There are many free templates on products such as Microsoft Word, or the internet that can help you write an effective CV. I hope this helps.

Which countries have the highest demand for English teachers?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	Hi Shimaa, Since you wish to learn English, then read books written in English and practice speaking English with friends and family members. No doubt, you've learned that it's a difficult language to read, write and speak because all the rules don't apply to the speaking and spelling of all the words. Regarding scholarships? We don't know what will occur regarding education in our universities. The tuition could rise even more because of our president-elect. So you might want to consider European universities initially. The hieroglyph might be easier to study. Best luck, Mark Wagner
	Hi Shimaa! The best way to improve your English language skills is to engage with people who speak it better than you can. Talk to the reference librarian at your local library to locate groups and organizations to which British and Americans or other English speakers are likely to belong and attend. Look for groups and organizations that have an interest area that you share. it could be academic, social, recreational. or other. This would not only help you with the language learning, but ii could also allow you to increase your circle of friends and have fun at the same time. Here is a great resource in Cleveland, Ohio. Browse through the Global Cleveland site to learn more. They are always encouraging and welcoming to people from other countries: http://globalcleveland.org/education/education-overview Here is a great site for finding scholarships: http://www.fastweb.com/ Please let me know if and how this helps. Keep me informed. I would like to follow your progress. 
	Hello Briana, Check your state's labor and statistics forecast or the whole of the US (Dept. of Labor) for this occupation in the coming years. One thing we know for certain isåÊthat healthcare professionals in general will be in demand for the foreseeable future with our aging population rises. :) 
	Maybe. It's not what you studied that matters, but what you learned. I was a creative writing and interdisciplinary double major. An English degree is a great way to learn critical thinking and communications skills. This comes through practice and spending significant time writing and researching. However, I do recommend double majoring in a more applied major (social sciences, engineering, math, etc). And an English degree in combination with many other degrees can go a long way. Currently I do artificial intelligence research for a venture backed startup. Being an English major didn't automatically get me this job or any other jobs I had in the past. But it did set me apart. The communication skills were helpful when I interviewed. On the job I was able to communicate technical and complex ideas effectively to different audiences (managers, other technical colleagues, and non-technical audiences). Structured thinking, clear articulation of ideas, and the ability communicate through writing are all useful skills that will be valuable in your career search. Pay rates vary from district to district, and even within districts. Smaller districts may pay less. Low income schools may pay more if they are seeking certain talents. I recommend you check the area you want to teach in (location) and simply ask the district. They probably have it listed on their website.
	Hey Lindsey! A simple Google search will provide you with an answer, I've also found this site below: http://www1.salary.com/high-school-teacher-Salary.html The salary will vary for each state, level of experience, and position (private school/public school). I would check with your state salaries. Good luck!

What college extracurriculars or organizations should I join that will help me get into medical school?



Here are responses we've found that are related to that question.


	hi christine, to specialize in treating asthma you'll likely need to become a pulmonologist. but most pulmonologists treat a wide variety of respiratory diseases other than asthma, including pneumonia, effusion, embolism, pneumothorax, emphysema, etc. although i'm a primary care doctor i've never heard or read about a glut of pulmonary specialists in the USA and i highly doubt that would happen anytime soon. so i would encourage you in your goal. good luck!
	Hi Christine! You asked about a very important and interesting area! Here is a professional organization that deals with Asthma and other respiratory conditions, which will allow you to become more familiar with the area: http://www.aaaai.org/ Through continued efforts to deal with asthma and other respiratory diseases, the future looks good: http://www.aaaai.org/about-aaaai/advocacy Best of luck! Please keep me posted. I would like to follow your progress! 
	Shaleah G, There is no age limit on receiving instructions in knowledge and skill. If you feel you are ready and have the time to receive the discipline that comes with training in the medical field then go for it. I wish you the best on your journey. 
	Hi Hanan: This is a complicated question because there are many unknown aspects, but I will try and make it simple: Lets start with competitive colleges. If you have taken AP classes in high school then that is a great section to put on your resume and name each of the classes. If you had a part time job in high school that would go under your job experience. If you have been an officer in a club or sport then list the name of club and which office you held such as Vice President. If you were on the school newspaper explain what you did in that position. If you were a volunteer for maybe a charity or a YMCA this is also an eye catcher for your resume. Anything good that you did extra while going to school should be recognized on your resume. Now lets talk about Medical School When you see your counselor at your medical school you should put down on your application all the science/medical classes that you have already taken and any volunteering or job that would help you get such as: volunteering at a hospital or a Drs. office; making good grades in your science classes; If you took any CPR classes or other classes that are in the medical field are a plus to help you into medical school, Keeping your grades up is a great way to get to go to the school you want; if you help out at a Senior Citizen place that is also a volunteer position and a plus for the medical school. Any and all of these ideas mentioned above wound help you to possible moved up the list for a possible entrance.
	Hi Hanan, That is a great question! I would recommend looking for opportunities that relate to something you have a personal passion for, but that you can also take a leadership role in. For example, can you organize a group of volunteers who regularly help patients at a local clinic? Colleges really look for traits of leadership and service, so I would recommend any type of volunteer opportunity where you can lead in a specific way as a great start to building your resume (and also you, personally!) and making a difference for your local community!
