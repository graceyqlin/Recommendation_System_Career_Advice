They listed a lot of reasons like having better hours, getting a chunk less(taken out) out of your paycheck because of not having to pay as much for insurance to cover you because you're not the actual doctor making the calls, and so on. None of these people were actually in the medical field though. So, I have a few questions to find out what's actually the real deal with being a physician assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the differences between being a full physician and a physician's assistant?\\r\\nDo you actually get paid a lot less than a physician? If so, Is it frustrating to be know that you're basically doing the same job as a full physician, but getting paid less than them? \\r\\nWhat would you say are the pros to the job? The frustrations?\\r\\nIf you wanted could you travel to different places because of your job? (like a traveling nurse)\\r\\nDo you spend more time with the patients than the doctors? (I'm a people person, so I'd like to have a lot of patient interaction)\\r\\nYour favorite part of being a physician assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you! :)\\r\\n  #doctor #medical #physician</td>\n",

       "7451   I'm very interested in pursuing a career in the medical field originally as a physician in the hospital, but many people have told me that it's not worth going to medical school for such a long time, and to become a physician assistant instead. They listed a lot of reasons like having better hours, getting a chunk less(taken out) out of your paycheck because of not having to pay as much for insurance to cover you because you're not the actual doctor making the calls, and so on. None of these people were actually in the medical field though. So, I have a few questions to find out what's actually the real deal with being a physician assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the differences between being a full physician and a physician's assistant?\\r\\nDo you actually get paid a lot less than a physician? If so, Is it frustrating to be know that you're basically doing the same job as a full physician, but getting paid less than them? \\r\\nWhat would you say are the pros to the job? The frustrations?\\r\\nIf you wanted could you travel to different places because of your job? (like a traveling nurse)\\r\\nDo you spend more time with the patients than the doctors? (I'm a people person, so I'd like to have a lot of patient interaction)\\r\\nYour favorite part of being a physician assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you! :)\\r\\n  #doctor #medical #physician   \n",

To be more specific, how long will it take me to pay off lones, how flexible are their hours and about how many cases will I get and how much will I make when I take on those cases?\\n#Specific-career-question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
