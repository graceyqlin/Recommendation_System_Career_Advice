0,What does a data scientist do?,"Hello,    I am going to a liberal art college in a fringe town next school year. The school does not have a data science major but I am highly interested in data science. (I will be going to double majors in Computer science and Statistics.) What are some steps should I do to become a data scientist? Is hard to find a data scientists internship in summer? What are some tips during my 4 years of colleges?     #women-in-stem #technology ##datascience #stemcareers #college-advice #computer-science ","Hi Yingyi,  Great question and excited to see you're interested in Data Science. Data Science is a not really a unified field and a bit buzzwordy. Data scientist come from all sorts of backgrounds (computer science, political science, physics, statistics, even Creative Writing [me!]) and work on all sorts of problems. One one hand you'll may have a data scientists working with advertisement data trying to predict target audiences and click through rates and on the other a data scientist using deep learning to analyze MRI scans for cancerous tumors. And all sorts of things in between. In my role as a Data Scientist at Talla, I research machine learning and deep learning technique to solve natural language problems like teaching a computer to read text, answer questions, and classify large corpuses of data.    You shouldn't worry about not having a Data Science major, your double major cover the majority of the baseline knowledge you'll need. Here's a few classes you should take to help with building skills fundamental to most data science work: Advanced (chose which one(s) look the most interesting)   The best way to get a sense of what it's like to be data scientist is doing data science. A great resource for this is Kaggle and DrivenData. Both host open competitions and challenges that anyone can participate in. You should look through the challenges, see which look interesting, download the data, and start building models. Kaggle has a great set tutorials as well that well teach you the basic skills on working with data, looking for patterns and building models. The great thing is you don't need a college degree, just jump in. The more hands on experience you get working with data, the better.   Closely related to that point is document and share the data science work you do. It will be very useful to show potential employers a portfolio of your work where you can point to specific examples of the tools, techniques and analysis you did. You can store code samples in github and write blog posts on Medium to highlight cool findings.   On internships, it honestly depends on where you are located. I'd recommend talking to your school's career center for help here.   Another piece of advice. Go on LinkedIn and look for data scientist in your area and reach out to them. Say you are a student, and ask if they have time for a phone call or coffee for questions. Professionals in general like providing advice and helping out students. So feel free to ask about what they do, things they'd learned, and any advice they have. At the end of the conversation you might also want to ask if there are any internship opportunities and if they can recommend you.   And finally in terms of general advice, study abroad if you have chance!  Take some humanities and social science classes. Especially ethics, philosophy, and social or political science. Our technologies have far outpaced social norms and policies. As a data scientist you may find yourself working on human data (customers, patients, and other categories of people) and your models will have repercussions on real lives. It's important to the general welfare of society to be cognizant about the potential unintended consequences and implications of your work.   Hope this was helpful. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have questions about Data Science or post here for more advice. Good luck!, Hi Yingyi, This is a great question! A double major in Comp Sci and Stats is a fantastic foundation for this area. The great news is that there are so many different ways to start working in data science and all different skills sets are required.  One possible suggestion is to join a group like WiDS - there is a Women in Data Science (WiDS) Group that holds regional events - one was just in March. Check out the speakers to get an idea of how broad the possibilities and talent really is: http://www.widsconference.org/speakers.html  You will start to see more and more job opportunities in this field - your majors are a great springboard for big data or data science or so many related data/STEM careers. There are also some great online programs at https://www.coursera.org (see https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)  You can also watch the WiDs videos: http://www.widsconference.org/videos.html (take notes on all the projects you like and start focusing in on possible areas that you would like to pursue.) One thing to consider is starting a Data Science Group/club at your school and watch the videos together as part of a club activity. This is what we did at our campus - we watched some of the conference together and added some local speakers and a networking event. It was so much fun and we met some great new peers at our own campus through this activity. It doesn't have to cost a lot either, get some chips and cookies and fire up the laptops. Find a faculty advisor to be a champion and include other areas/departments. Data science has sooo many applications to almost all industries., There is nothing hotter in career choices these days than ""Big Data"".  Here at AT&T we are hiring outside of the company to find data scientists to work in this new area.  Our company is offering a degree in conjunction with the University of Oklahoma Gallogly College of Engineering.  I would suggest you  look at this online degree.  https://janux.ou.edu/masters/dsa/"
1,What does a data scientist do?,I want to be a scientist #scientist #researcher,"Researcher is a very thrilling and demanding profession, but in my opinion the heartaches are certainly worth the rewards achieved through discovery and inovation. My best recomendation to pave your way with research is to become involved. Regardless of your education level, there are usually opportunities to get involved in research, develop your experimenter skills and figure out whether this is the career path for you. At the pre university level, science teachers might have interest in supporting you with after school research projects, at the undergraduate level undergraduate research if you have time to fit it in your curriculum, semester internship/summer internship will give you a full time experience and grad school hopefully you’re in a research fellow position. Regardless of whether you want to pursue a career in academia or industry experience is the way to make a successful career out of it. Reach out and be inquisitive. All the best., Hi. You will study very hard and with effort. You may Identify the research area that you more like for example: chemistry, physics,  technology, materials sciences or biology like me!!! you can research about  amounts of marvelous things of our world,
After in the future you can follow steps of professors for learn very much.
A scientist  is learning constantly but is important help and teach too."
2,What does a data scientist do?,"I'm currently a third year computer science major, and I've recently discovered a passion for data science and machine learning. I've been trying to learn more about it, and I've found many online resources (Udacity's data analyst, machine learning nano degrees, Stanford's Intro to Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng, and various courses offered on Udemy). With all of these great resources, which one would be best for someone who is comfortable programming and wants to get more practical experience? Any advice would be very helpful (and even more so if you are a current data scientist!) and would be greatly appreciated!    #machine-learning #data-analysis #data #big-data #computer-science #computer-software #data-science #data-mining #data-visualization","Hey Albert, awesome to see you're interested in Data Science. So I've taken Udacity courses (machine learning nano-degree) and bunch of other classes online. Since you're still in college, I would recommend seeing what classes your college offers for machine learning/data science. If you haven't already, you should take classes in statistics, probability and linear algebra to shore up your mathematical foundations. It's much easier to do this when you're in college and don't have distractions that trying to re-learn it on your own when you leave.  In terms of Udacity, I'm a huge fan of their programs. The machine learning nano-degree is more relevant program for you (data analyst is for folks coming from a non-technical and non-mathematical background wanting to do simple descriptive stats and analysis). You can technically take the majority of the courses for free. The nano-degree just adds in some additional applied exercises. As a heads up all the coding exercises and jupyter notebooks for the nanodegree are on github (https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning). If want feedback and grading, you'll have to pay for the courses. Also check out fastai's courses on deep learning and machine learning  (http://course.fast.ai/) and (http://forums.fast.ai/t/another-treat-early-access-to-intro-to-machine-learning-videos/6826). Jeremey Howard does a great job of teaching applied data science concepts and provides lots of practical advice on building and delpoying data science models.   I am a data scientist that focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning to NLP problems. A couple of pieces of advice from a practitioners point of view. Learn about how to properly split up you data into train/validation/test sets and how use cross-validation for improving your models. The udacity free machine learning course (the sebastian thrum one) is fantastic on this point. More advanced data scientist will understand how to develop training data that is actually representative of the real world. Andrew Ng Machine Learning Yearning (http://www.mlyearning.org/) is a great resource for practical tips and pointers  about using machine learning in production.  90 percent of your life will be data processing. So if you haven't already, spend some time getting familiar with Python, pandas and numpy and learn how to clean, format, and handle different data formats. Finally, practice a lot. Do competitions on Kaggle and other data science competition sites. Don't worry about doing well, just focus on getting lots of experience handling data and building intuitions.    Feel free to ask more specific questions if you have any. Good luck!, Hi Albert,  This is a great question that I come across in just about every career fair I go to these days. I agree with the two previous answers. Most courses today will provide you with a relatively comprehensive introduction to practical data science. What I find  lacking in most new graduates applying for a job is the experience of applying these concepts to real world problems (really want to emphasize real-world here).   I know it is an unrealistic to expect real world experience of fresh college graduate. Moreover, a lot of the academic/courses problems are tailored to the topics and far from being representative of what a data scientist may do on the job. In the real world machine learning and data science problems in general tend to be messy and complex. So once you are done with the course I highly recommend that you get on Kaggle (Kaggle.com) and start competing. The more of these competitions you participate in, the more familiar you will get with the intricacies real-world problems bring.  I interview over 30 new graduates with data science background a year. Almost always I find those who have extended experience participating in Kaggle have a much easier time passing the interview, ramping up on the job and go on to grow and have much greater impact on the team thank compared to those who learn on the job.  I by no means intend to suggest that one can't go on to succeed by just doing the courses. However, i am assuming you really want an advantage that gets you noticed by an employer and want to succeed in your passion. Kaggle will get you closer to that.  Lastly, even Kaggle problems aren't exactly real-world problems. They are cleaned to ensure sensitive data isn't exposed to the public and they only focus on a small scope of the larger problem so they are solved in a reasonable timeframe. , Hi Albert, you chose a great field to study. I have taken many online courses including the ones you mentioned, such as Udacity Machine learning Nanodegree and Andrew Ng machine learning course on Coursera. In addition to that, I also took Deeping learning Nanodegree on Udacity and Deep learning specialization taught by Andrew on Coursera. Overall, they are good quality courses. However, there is some level of difference between data science and machine learning.   For data science, it relates more to mathematics and statistics. You focus more on explanatory analysis. You will analyze lots of data and try to find the underlying relationship between them and also explain them. Explanation plays a huge role as a data scientist. Not only you need to build a great model, but also you need to explain them in business words and try your best find the causal factors.  For machine learning, it relates more to computer science. You focus more on building models with smaller errors. Sometimes, the model you built is a black box. You won't be able to understand what is the root cause to make your model bad or good. In other words, as a machine learning engineer favor accuracy more than explanation.  Due to this, machine learning engineer will spend quite large amount of time on parameter tuning and model training.  With that being said, If you want to be a data scientist. You may need to learn more about statistics and math. The data analysis nanodegree on Udacity is a great start. If you want to be a Machine Learning Engineer, you need to be really good in programming. You most likely will be using Python for it. Proficiency in Java or C# would also be a great plus, because eventually you will productionize your models. After you gain proficiency in programming, I will recommend the machine learning course taught by Andrew on Coursera as a start. If you want more advanced stuff, you can take Deeping learning specialization taught by Andrew.  Since you are CS major, I assume you want to be a machine learning engineer. I worked as a data scientist @ Airbnb. Here at San Francisco Bay area, Machine learning engineer interview will still test you most on coding skills instead of modeling. So be good at coding can really help you land a job as MLE. I hope this helps you :), Hi Albert, you ask a great question.  There are so many choices that narrowing them down can be difficult.  I have taken the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity and based on my experience, I recommend short listing it.  Why?  Udacity is going to teach you about the subject and then ask you to demonstrate your learning with a practical application.  These applications are scaled down versions of what you might expect to be asked to do in the real world.  They will be evaluated and you will understand how to improve if needed.  When you are complete with the training, you'll have a portfolio of accomplishments that you can demonstrate.  More importantly, when you finish and have your certificate, you'll likely be approached by leading technology companies interested in offering you a job.   Who backs Udemy's courses versus Udacities, for example?  Look at who is endorsing these courses as a way to narrow them down.   Having said that, you can also take a number of the free courses elsewhere and then return to the paid offerings.  Yes, investing ~$650 at Udacity can lead to a potential career. :)  , The most important thing I've learned in my career is the importance of real world application. Regardless if one obtains Data/ML skills from a degree program, online course, or other means, once you land a job in this field the most important skill you can have is translating real world use cases into the technology, and vis versa. I recommend finding course that have real word examples or taking on projects of your own. During job interviews, most teams wants to hear actual stories and examples of how you've applied your learning rather that simply what you know. It can also be helpful to learn some of the industry tools (Splunk, Tableau, etc) so you can hit the ground running in your future roles.  https://www.datascienceweekly.org/articles/the-simple-process-to-get-real-world-data-science-experience"
3,What does a data scientist do?,"I've been looking into data science careers, and I know that it is closely related with machine learning and big data. I'm confused as to what the difference between data science and machine learning is, and also how big data plays in a part in both fields. What exactly is data science and machine learning, and how are they related to each other (and how does big data tie into them)? Any help would be greatly appreciated.    #data-analysis #data-science #computer-science #computer-software #big-data #machine-learning #data-visualization #data #data-mining","Data Science is a rather broad field that covers many areas, and machine learning is one of them. Data Science in the industry currently has three major tracks: analytics, generalist, and machine learning.  , Data science is a discipline that works with machine learning and Big Data, as well as many other things. I work as a Data Scientist, and while I do use machine learning and Big Data in my job, it is not all I do.  Also, you need to consider that there are different types of data scientists.    Machine Learning is, at its most basic, a predictive model created by feeding it data. Let us imagine we have a list of houses that sold recently. We have two columns, one with the square footage of the house and one with the price the house sold for. We could feed this data into a machine learning algorithm and it will build a model for us. Now if I ask the model how much a 2000 sq ft house will sell for, the model will provide us price based on the list of prices we had given it. Now obviously we use much more complex data sets with many many more variables, but at the end of the day machine learning boils down to asking a computer to either classify an object (is the picture a cat or dog?), provide a numeric value (regression - think of the house price example), or cluster (see how data should be best grouped based on attributes - think of all the students in your high school and how they can be grouped: jocks, drama clubs kids, nerds, popular crowd).  Big Data is massive, fast moving, data sets. It is a popular term, but not all data science or machine learning involves Big Data. Twitter is great example of big data with millions of tweets every few minutes.   In my case, I am what you might call an operational data scientist. I work in financial compliance at Verizon helping to hunt down people who are ""gaming the system"" or stealing from us by using loop holes in our policies. The biggest part of my job is finding, gathering, and cleaning data so I can analyze it. Once I have the data I may run it through a machine learning algorithm to create a predictive model they may help us to predict which people we should look at more closely (make the haystack a little smaller - easier to find the needle in.    A big data example I worked on with another company was using the voice recordings or people calling customer service. I was able to determine certain speech patterns that were more likely to be used by someone trying to commit some type of fraud. We were able to use this information to alert the customer care reps who to be on the look for., ""data science"" is a more broad category, and ""machine learning"" is a subset. kinda like ""medicine"" would be a broad category and ""heart surgery"" would be a smaller subset of that discipline. So ""all machine learning is a type of data science, but not all data science involves machine learning""... ;-), Data science includes the algorithms and processing methodology for entire data as well. Machine learning includes the implementing different algorithms for data to get best output."
4,What does a data scientist do?,What kind of companies do data scientists work for?  How can I become one?     #data-science #data-analysis #big-data,"The definition of this newfangled title ""data scientist"" is basically a super-awesome statistician, with a variety of skills and experience to match (I see the title as a senior title, and have seen it at the C-level).  Since you can apply statistics to a wide variety of information, this title would be transportable across a variety of industries where extracting information from large amount of structured or unstructured data (aka ""big data"") is useful, such as pharmaceutical, network security, defense/intelligence, medical, financial, government... If you're interested in quantitative analysis of the financial markets, my suggestion is to start working on a model.  In fact, a financial quant I used to work with spent his free time working on a football (aka soccer) player performance prediction system, while I (as a network engineer), spent very little time looking at utilizing simple stats to extract data out of network traffic.  You can use these examples of your expertise during an interview., Data scientists in a product-oriented organization (think about companies like Airbnb/Uber/Facebook) are there to build better products. They make it happen through 1) aiding better decision making 2) participating in building data-powered product. For 1) data scientists perform quantitative analyses, build dashboards and run experiments. For 2) data scientists design and implement algorithm-based, automated solutions that are typically consumer facing.  , Hi Flora! Data Scientist title is often used to describe jobs that vary drastically. Depending on the company and amount of data they have, it could mean pure Data Analysis where the person extracts data from a data store/warehouse and creates meaningful visualization and aggregation on top of that data. This branch answers questions around operational reporting of data. It could on the other hand mean utilizing more sophisticated statistical and machine learning methodologies to extract patterns out of data and do predictive science based not that. This requires a formal degree in Maths, Statistics, Physics or a similar discipline. This branch is more focused on creating data driven products. Hope this helps and God Luck!, In my view, Data scientist job is beyond big data/data mining/statistics/programming skills. A data scientist should be these qualities to be successful in any industry: Hope this clarifies your question., Data scientist means a lot of things, but in general I can say the role includes a lot of working with data to do something useful. In some cases, such as in my job, it might be to answer questions nobody else has answers to, in business speak referred to as ""drawing insights"". In some cases, the purpose is to build algorithms to predict things. I notice you have posted a few other questions about finance, and I think in this field the predictive analytics might be most relevant.  The basic requirement for a data scientist is to be good at quantitative analysis. Make sure you are taking math and economics classes, and it might even be helpful to learn some programming software such as Stata, R, SPSS, mySQL, Python etc."
0,How long do I need to study to become a surgeon?,How long would I have to stay in school? If I wanted to go to community college is there some that may help me pursue my dream of being a surgeon?

1,How long do I need to study to become a surgeon?,How to become doctor in abord and become citizens of there and what to study  #r,Check the link below. https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-steps-of-becoming-a-doctor-in-India
2,How long do I need to study to become a surgeon?,"I have wanted to become a surgeon since I was 6, how is it to save lives? DO you see new things everyday? #medicine  #surgeon ","I can't say personally what it's like but my dad is a surgeon so I have a family perspective. 

First, the hours are long and you're spread all over the place. Depending on what kind of surgeon you are, you'll need to work at a hospital or surgery center for some of the big stuff. Patients meet the doctor in an office space normally, to determine if surgery is needed or if some other form of treatment is better. This looks and feels like any doctor's office you've been to. If you need to perform surgery, then you  head to a hospital or surgery center. 

Hospitals have full staff, big and expensive imaging devices, emergency care, all the major medical stuff. To work at a hospital, typically you need to agree to be on call. This means that on certain weekends or evenings, you'll need to have a phone near you and be ready and able (aka, nearby and sober) to visit patients. These are the doctors that you'll see on hand at night at the Emergency Room. This means as a doctor, there's a lot of time you'll be unavailable to hang out with friends or family. It's scheduled in advance, so you'll be able to make plans, but it can be hard for people outside your field to understand and work with you.

Surgery centers are not 24 hour operations, so I don't think there is an on call schedule. But they aren't fully equipped and staffed for major operations so it doesn't work for all surgeons. However, the reduced options mean reduced costs, so they are often great options for doctors and patients to save money. Many doctors work both in surgery centers as well as hospitals to get the bets of both worlds.

Second, there's a lot of continued education. You need to be certified to practice. Your college education is not certification, it's prep for it.  Once certified, you need to renew. Renewing means you need to attend special classes or conferences that go over some of the latest advancements in your field. This keeps your skills up to date and relevant. Usually there's travel involved, which you can write off for taxes since these are required for your business. I remember going to Boston and Salt Lake City with my parents as a small kid, staying with a nanny while my parents attended a conference and seeing the city after it ended. It's not all work, but if you aren't up to the commitment, you'll lose your licence. There are of course other requirements for renewal but I didn't see or deal with them as a family member.

Last, there's a lot of background costs you might not realize that will influence your working life. Malpractice lawsuits are always a possibility, so you need insurance for that. Some of the equipment, like x-ray machines, are incredibly expensive.  Plus, you'll need to have staff to handle billing, scheduling, and probably a medical assistant (MA). This is why medical costs are so high, individual doctor's offices are full blown businesses where multiple people are following their own career paths and it all orbits the doctors. If you're business savvy, or want freedom to make your own decisions and don't mind the extra time and costs, you have a private practice for your office. You'll likely still need access to hospital space for surgeries, so you'll likely still have an on call schedule. These days however, the costs of running the business side of doctors' offices are so high and time consuming that doctors will often join group practices. This allows for shared resources and support personnel. 

It's a lot to think about. If you love the idea of practicing medicine, there's LOTS of options. From nursing, to elderly care, family doctors, surgeons, physical therapists, and emergency responders - no matter where your talents lie, there's an option. Shoot for the option that you are not only interested in, but have aptitude for. A surgeon that barfs at the sight of blood or a nurse with no empathy are going to have short careers. Pick the one you want to be the best at, and go for it. :)"
3,How long do I need to study to become a surgeon?,I want to become a heart surgeon. #surgeon #doctor #healthcare #cardiology #medicine ,"If by college you mean undergraduate (4 year) university, then the answer is simply the best one you can go to!  The ""official"" decision to be a surgeon will not be made as an undergraduate.  It will be made in medical school (next step), and even then that mostly means deciding to apply to a surgery residency, which is yet another step.  Undergrad is still a few steps back.  Academically speaking, the most important thing is to go to a good university and get the best grades and MCAT scores you can.    It is true that some undergraduate universities are associated with medical centers (for example, Stanford).  So if you are really sure you want to be a surgeon of some type, you could try to target an undergrad school that is paired with a medical institution, which might allow you to do surgery/medical research as an undergraduate.  That being said, this is *not* something you should worry too much about.  Good luck!"

3,What are career options for an art major?,I'm interested in becoming an artist.  #art #fine-art #career #career-counseling #college ,"Depending on what type of artist you want to be will determine what track you follow as an artist. What do you like?  What medium do you like to work in? What inspires you? What art field have you seen that excites you?  Whatever the answers are to these personal questions might help you decide what track to pursue as you work your way to college.    The simplest answer though is just do it.  Just draw, paint, design... Just do it now and keep doing it every day and then when you're in college do it some more.  You become the artist you want to be by just doing what you're passionate about.  Once you hone your skills, learn, practice, understand and continue to improve you'll begin to find your place and the career that works for you.  Check out the website in the suggested steps section, it is a nice list of art and art related jobs., Your question has merit however the term artist is far too broad to give any kind of definitive advice. The arts is such a broad field and each type of artist has to plan based upon their kind of art they produce eg. a illustrator for children's books as opposed to an artist who produces illustrations for medical anatomy publications., Hi Azra, I think it's worthwhile to explore what kind of art you'd like to pursue.  Do you want to be a fine artist and sell paintings in galleries, or make sculptures? Or maybe work in the entertainment industry creating concept art or matte paintings for games or films? The art world is very broad, but my advice is to explore different types of art, find what you enjoy most, and try to learn about that more in depth! Don't be scared to try new things, you may be surprised by what you like once you try it out."
4,What are career options for an art major?,"i want to get into an art college to pursue art. I have gone to summer art programs, attended art shows, and go to an art high school. Will all this help me get into an art college?","Back when I went to college, outside activities were not as important as they may be today.    I also did not start with art school as I was unsure of my abilities and had no idea what I wanted to do with my future.  I went to a liberal arts college and minored in art with a major in English.   I then decided I wanted to be an artist and went to art school taking art classes only (I believe in undergraduate art school you still have to take math, english, history etc. in order to graduate - that was covered at the liberal arts college) in order to get into graduate school.  I graduated with an MFA in 1977.   In all cases regarding art school, the main emphasis was what the admissions folks thought about my portfolio.  It is my feeling that you will be accepted for your artistic ability, your original creativity, and your knowledge and usage of art materials and tools.  Since your outside activities all have to do with art, I'm sure they will be taken into consideration, but the bottom line (especially regarding graduate school) is your body of work.  I hope this helps and best wishes for an artistic future.   "

We then spend hours practicing in simulators and flying aircraft similar to the test aircraft.

The day before the flight, I have to check and study the weather for the flight.  I have to talk to the engineers and confer any updates that would affect the flight. We get together in briefings and go over the play by play details of every movement and test event we expect to execute. Once the entire team (test engineers, test pilots, and administration) is satisfied what we are doing is safe and effective, we then give a ""go"" decision for the next day.

The next day starts early in the morning with final checks of the weather, systems analysis, areas we are to fly and crew readiness.  Then we perform the pre-flight, aircraft systems checks and power up for take off. Typical flights last anywhere from 1 hour to 4 hours.  In all, a test flight day may last up to 10 hours.

There are many more items that go on.  When we are not directly preparing for a flight, we are working with the engineers to calculate various speeds and parameters for the aircraft to fly in.  In addition, we write reports, give analysis, design checklists and even have to give presentations on new systems.

I hope this helps.

Kevin, Depending upon what airline and where you are based your day to day life will vary greatly. 
Freight-
 I flew freight feeder for about a year, of that year I also was a training Captain, meaning I trained the new pilots who were coming to work there.  Flying for a cargo feeder your morning starts about 5am with checking the weather, the aircraft, and then finally a dispatcher to be legally released to go fly. Next you will load up your cargo and possibly fuel if it was not done already. This can take anywhere from 20 minutes to over 2 hours.  You will fly usually 1-3 short flights with a total flight time under 3 hours, offloading some or all of the cargo at your stops. Every stop also requires more paperwork. Next you will spend the day in a hotel at your last stop, returning to the airport anywhere from 3-4pm and repeat the process, except you are gathering cargo at your stops to bring back to your original destination, after the cargo is off and the plane is put away for the night, all of your paperwork from the day is finished and turned in, usually leaving around 530-7pm depending on the specific schedule. You repeat this schedule 4-5 times a week, sometimes a different schedule one of the days of the week.  To get thru the day a good nap in the middle of the day is a must. 

Passenger airline-
The schedules vary greatly, everything in the airline world is seniority based. If you just start at an airline your schedules will start out with reserve, this means you are a back up pilot who is on call. The time to be at the airplane vary from 2 hours to 12 hours and could be less or more depending upon the airlines specific rules. After you have been at the airline a while you will find yourself with a schedule of flights for the month, the flights can be locals, where you are back to your home base the same day, to flights that can be 4 or more days away from your home base. Most airlines will have your flight start and end at your home base, occasional they do not and they will book you as a passenger  to get back to your home. (you get paid for this flight). During your 1-4 days of work you could just fly one flight that is short 30 min or over 4 hours, or multiple flights, up to 6 or more. There are many legal requirements on the length of the day you may work, and more specific, the number of hours you may fly in a day, these numbers vary depending upon the time you start working and the number of flights that day.  The reward is ending up in some awesome locations that have many attractions or sites to see and food from many different regions. "

2,What should I study in college if I want to be a pilot?,I would like to be a pilot. i want to know if being a pilot will benefit me financially. #pilot #airplane #flying,"The initial investment required to become a commercial pilot is, on average, north of $100,000. That's a major hurdle that you'll have to overcome right off the bat. These days, a lot of pilots are starting their careers beneath a mountain of debt. I was able to avoid that because I'm a veteran, and was able to put my GI Bill benefits to use. Salaries start low in aviation - in the mid-$20K range - but can go very high - north of $250K for captains with a lot of seniority at a major airline. It takes years to get to that point, though. At airlines, typically, you'll be quoted an hourly rate that sounds high, but that's only for actual flight time - all the other time you spend doing your job is technically unpaid. Most airlines guarantee a minimum number of flight hours per month, so you are essentially being paid a base salary. For example, $45/hr x minimum 60 hours per month = approximately $32K per year. If you fly more than that, of course, you'll be paid more. The company, however, will do what they can to limit such ""overtime"" on your part. Some jobs will also have per diem pay and flight benefits, which are fun to use with your family. Avoid limiting your sights to the airlines. There are myriad opportunities you can pursue as a commercial pilot that have nothing to do with flying for an airline. Most of my flying is air ambulance operations. You can tow banners, haul cargo, do aerial photography/survey, agricultural spraying, firefighting, law enforcement, or teach others to fly as an instructor. The salary ladder in aviation is a long one to climb, and you need to be in it because you love flying, or you'll probably have a hard time summoning the motivation to put up with some of this career's pitfalls. It's certainly not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you care about maximizing the return on your educational investment, it may not be a wise choice - but if you love flying, you won't be able to imagine doing anything else., Glassdoor.com gives the salary ranges for positions and you can even limit the data to geographical location., Hi,
Here is a good link with some information about being a pilot...you can make good money but it will take you time to learn, log flight hours and gain experience with smaller aircraft and you may not make a lot of money initially.   It will take time...if you are really interested, it is a great career...I am not a pilot but I have pilots in my family.  If you are in it for just the money, I would suggest rethinking your career options.  Pilots work a lot of hours, are gone for long periods of time and spend a lot of time sleeping at airports.  Good luck! http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/modern/pilot2.htm"
3,What should I study in college if I want to be a pilot?,I'm a senior at high school and I want to be a airline pilot # #student #high-school #pilot #college ,"Pilots have many options to obtain this goal.  It all depends on if this is going to be a career or a hobby.   As a hobby you can go to many of the flight schools in your area and simply sign up and pay your way.  If you are thinking of a career and want to fly what they call Legend Airlines:  American, Continental, Delta, United....ect then you will need a 4 year degree.  Many schools will offer a degree to help you.   Some pilots choose a school like Embry Riddle which focuses on that degree without a lot of fluff.  An economical way to get that pilots licence and degree is to go through the military.  They offer many options and provide you with the hours it takes to get to that legend airline.  , The Military is the cheapest route to go. I dont know about the previous comment about having a degree. I know some people that do not have a degree that got hired, and with a so called pilot shortage, airlines are luring Helicopter pilots away. Go to a flight school and talk to a pilot. Find out if it is for you. Take a discovery flight, take the controls of the plane."
4,What should I study in college if I want to be a pilot?,i want to know the pilot #teaching,"To become a pilot, you have to go to school that offer the program you are looking for. There are some that just focus on aviation. When I went thru this process, I took a couple of visits to see which one fit my needs. Depending on your school, they usually start off with ground control then single engine then you work your way up to commercial airplanes. If you can get into the air force academy, I would suggest that route. Good Luck!"

I have to say that working in rehabilitation is awesome career. I think you'll really like it. Here's a short answer to your question:  (PT) Physical Therapists go to SEVEN years of school: 4 years for a general BS + 3 years for a Doctorate in Physical Therapy
(PTA) Physical Therapist Assistants go to TWO years of school: 2 years for an Associate's in Physical Therapy
(AT) Athletic Trainers go to FOUR or SIX years of school: currently, it only requires a bachelor's in Athletic Training but anyone who starts school in 2022 or later must complete a general BS + 2 years for a Master's in Athletic Training. All three careers have a lot in common, and you probably worked with all three at different times (which is where you might have mixed up the term physical trainer.)

This is a great question. I myself was a Division 1 athlete in college and would have to say that it was one of the most rewarding experiences. My college experience was very different from others who did not play sports, there were sacrifices I made to keep up with my academics and athletics. But one of the greatest skills I learned during my time as an athlete, was time management. When it comes to academics, you will learn how to prioritize your work loan and meet deadlines. Your athletics obligations consist of practice, games, conditioning, lifting, and coaches meetings. Though it was challenging, it was rewarding in that I had the opportunity to play a sport that I loved, at a very competitive level, while also getting my education.

2,I’ve been a legal secretary for five years. What are my next career options?,"My mom has some friends in the legal field and they've offered me the opportunity to intern with them so I can get ""a feel"" for the practice but I don't want to pick up something I might not want to do. #experiencelaw #legalintern #legal-studies #legal-services #women-in-law ","Life is as much about figuring out what you don't want to do that will lead you down a path of what you do and do not enjoy, what you are and are not passionate about. Make a decision after you experience the internship., I agree with all the answers above. Internships are incredibly helpful. I'd encourage you to try the internship and be open to learning as much as you can while you are there. At the very least, you'll know more about what interests and inspires you. Like Jenna said, make sure you understand what is expected of you while you are there. Also, be clear about your schedule and when you can/can't be there. While you're there, ask questions and be as curious about the day-to-day as you are about the exciting meetings, court appearances, etc. That will help you get a well-rounded sense of the job. , I agree- internships are awesome ways to learn what you do and do not like about a particular field. You will not be forced to go into a career as a result, but it's a good way to get some exposure.  I would make sure you are clear on the expectations for dress code, attendance, duties you will/will not be expected to perform, and if you will or will not be paid, and what you would like to get out of the experience.  Do you want to go to court, work on a negotiation, prepare a document, etc.?  If you go in with some specific goals, then you will have something to work toward, and that might help your confidence level as well., Justaney,

Abby's answer nailed it! This is an opportunity that should not be passed up. You will learn not only about law, but also about yourself. If you are seriously contemplating law, the thought of an internship might scare you away? Why? Because the role is glorified by the entertainment industry.  Every job there is has both good and bad aspects, and knowing both sides can help you make the right decisions. However, if you do it and it is a bad experience, does not necessarily mean it is not for you. There is a lot of difference from one office to the next. Anyway, just give it a try! I bet you have fun!

3,I’ve been a legal secretary for five years. What are my next career options?,"My parents want me to become a lawyer, but I’m not sure. #undecided #lawyer #law #legal #legal-services ","Hi Regan, I definitely agree with Kim's response that going into the law (or any career for that matter) mainly because it is the career that your parents want for you, is not the best reason to choose a career path, and law school is far from ""fun"" even if you find it interesting and a good education. I went to law school and thought I wanted to be a lawyer; I practiced financial services law for over 6 years and decided to leave the practice of law for a business-side job, mostly because it was repetitive and I didn't feel like I was working for a higher mission, as I was in a small law firm. I can honestly say that, if I had gone to law school based solely on my parents' desires, I would not have finished! It is very challenging and competitive in addition to being costly.  It's true that your day-to-day activities will largely depend on the area of law, however, almost all legal jobs require some level of research, analysis, writing, and advocacy. And as Kim pointed out, attention to detail is probably the biggest hallmark of being an attorney, regardless of your job. Most legal practitioners' main job is to advocate for their clients, and whether they are representing them in court, in business transactions, or trying to advance their clients' cause in a policy context (lobbying for example), some research into the current laws/regulations, and then presenting that information orally or in writing will be required.     I recommend looking into different legal careers (this link is a good place to start) to see if any of it interests you. https://www.thebalancecareers.com/legal-career-opportunities-2164281  Bear in mind that law school can be very expensive, and there are many other legal degrees that you can pursue that are not a JD (which requires 3 years of schooling). If you choose a legal practicing job, you would also need to pass a state bar exam, which is very difficult and entails keeping up a certain level of continuing legal education each year. Best of luck on whatever career path you choose! , Regan, I am not a lawyer, but, have done some work with some of them. I just wanted to make sure you got an answer to this. I think a lot will depend on what area of law you go into. Also, law school is extremely difficult. If you decide to become a lawyer only because that is what your parents want you to do, and it's not something you truly want, school will be very hard. Yes, law can be ""fun,"" but it also involves a lot of research and writing. Very few cases go to trial, but you will still work at preparing your cases as if you are going to go to trial. No detail can be overlooked.  I'm not sure if any of this would be fun to you. I like the mental challenge, trying to find ways to get people to say what you need them to say when you have them under oath, for example, such as in depositions. Also, not all law involves handling cases. You could be writing wills, drafting contracts, etc. I hope you get this worked out in a way that is satisfactory to you! What will you be if you decide not to become a lawyer? Kim, Being a lawyer can be very fun and very rewarding.  But as the other posts have indicated it requires a lot of work, time, money, and attention to detail.  As with most challenging things in life it can be well worth it.  You indicated that your parents want you to be a lawyer.  Do you have any interest in it?  I think it's important for you to explore the legal field yourself.  See if you can get a job or internship even a volunteer opportunity in a law firm, with a government office with attorneys, a legal non-profit, or even in a courthouse.  Anything to give you exposure to lawyers and the legal field.  That will help you understand what it entails and if you think it might be fun.  There are different fields of practice and different types of things you can do with a law degree.  You do not necessarily have to practice law.  You could use your JD in other ways just depending on what you want.  So I think you could find being a lawyer a lot of fun.  I gage from your question that you do not want to be doing paperwork at a desk all day.  There are a lot of attorneys who don't.  Some attorneys spend many of their days in court and at hearings or meeting with their clients.  Some attorneys teach.  Some work in government or for non-profits.   I hope that this helps give you an idea of the broad range of things you can do with your law degree if you choose to pursue it.  Good luck!"
4,I’ve been a legal secretary for five years. What are my next career options?,i want to work as a legal advisor for a firm but i don't have any idea of which field to go for? #commerce #legal-studies #advocacy #legal-advice #legal-writing,"The educational requirements for legal advisors are equal to those of lawyers and attorneys. Before attending law school, legal advisors typically earn a bachelor's degree in pre-law or a comparable discipline. After graduating, potential legal advisors are required to take and pass the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and enroll in a law school that is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). In total, lawyers can expect to be in school for about seven years after high school. Some legal advisors may choose to go on to graduate school and receive a master's degree in a law-related discipline, such as a Master of Laws (LLM). Legal advisors are required to have passed the bar after graduating from law school. Additionally, they must attain licensure from their state before advising on legal matters. Some states also require legal workers to pass an ethics exam prior to practicing law. Additionally, legal advisors must hone communication and negotiation skills. Strong judgments skills are also a necessity, and legal advisors must be prepared to make ethical and moral decisions."
0,Is it worth going getting a degree in Computer Science if I am already an expert in programming?, #computer-programming ,"First of all, be confident! I would say it is totally feasible to self-learn C++ programming, although there are always people complaining some of the confusing and complex features of this programming language. I actually taught myself C++ 10 years ago when I was in high school and knew nothing about programming, and found out it is actually pretty fun(I admit a little bit challenging without too many online sources/interactive tools back to that time, but that also comes together with a sense of accomplishment when you actually figure it out).  If you are already a programmer of other languages, it should not be that hard for you to ship code in C++ within a few hours investigation of the official tutorials(http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/). And you can always find good online notebooks for comparing the difference between C++ and other languages you might already knew. e.g. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/Comparisons/Java Even if C++ is the first language you touch, there is no need to worry since at least you still have great advantage over me when I picked it up 10 years ago. There are countless sources online that can help you to plan your learning, practice coding.  You can take courses (here is a good one for beginners: https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-running-fixing-code#syllabus, although it is actually a C course, but there is no much difference between C and C++ in the beginning, and this can help you to learn how to write code, debug and compile with C style), or you can try codecademy which provide online debugging tools and tutorials, but you may lose the joy of setting up your own environment.  Regardless of whether or not you have programming experience, be sure you get enough readings. This is even more important when you are learning some language like C++.  Some popular references to list: C++ primer 5th edition(which contains detailed explanations about how the language built up and work, making it suitable for all kinds of people); Programming: principals and practices using C++(this is more about practical advices and can be used as tutorial);  <span style=""color: rgb(79, 79, 79);"">Thinking in C++(very useful for real case programming and engineering usage and tricks); </span> The Design and Evolution of C++(more of a deep-dive book for problems like how C++ implement backend compiling, memory management, but interesting and will you save you from the confusion of pointers, multiple inheritance etc.). Last and least, be sure to practice and be patient. This is actually true for all kinds of learning and especially important for learning to program and I feel, even more important for learning to program in C++, because C++ tends to be less intuitive in the beginning and needs time to dive both internal about the backend and external about the libraries to become an expert.  No matter you are learning this language for, try practicing it starting from debugging simple problems in the reference books, and gradually change yourself by increasing the project size the problem complexity.  If you cannot find projects challenging enough in the references or in you real life, try get some inspirations from C++ topic in Github https://github.com/topics/cpp , there are always enough area for you to explore!"

3,Is it worth going getting a degree in Computer Science if I am already an expert in programming?,I am a senior about to graduate from high school. I've already been accepted into college and will pursue attaining a degree in computer science.  #computer #school #programming,"I would look at the school's courses would help.  If the courses are taught using Java or C++ that would be a good place to start.  Learning a bit about the coding structure will allow you to focus on the course material rather than learning syntax.  Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/) and Code Academy (https://www.codecademy.com/) are some good places to start.  http://www.learnjavaonline.org/ and https://www.learn-cpp.org/ will give you some interactive experience as well. The CS coursework is designed to teach you the basics and go from there, so there is not much you need to know beforehand in most schools.  If there are some additional courses you are looking at, there are probably some online course that will teach you the basics before the class begins. But the best tip I can give is to learn how to manage your time.  If you can sit down and do your coursework you will have plenty of time to have a social life as well as do well academically.  , Nigel, I don't know the what the ""best"" web site is, to learn abut computer science, but if i did, I would hesitate to give it to you.  Why? Because you want to learn about computer science and a really good way to learn is to explore, absorb and to output.  So get on the internet, do some searches, and start exploring.  Take notes of what you find and where you found it.  Then after you have explored 3 or 4 of them, write an email to your favorite relative and include a summary of what you have found and what you have learned. Do a compare and contrast, both with how the web sites compare to each other but how they compare with what you were expecting to find. Repeat this with three or four more again and agan. Do that for a couple of hours every day, week by week (7 - 10 hours per week) and by the end of the summer, you will be an expert on what web sites are out there that help kids learn about computer science. You will know a lot about computer science and you will know a lot about project management.

1,What is most important on a resume or CV when applying to tech companies?,"In my Personal, Career, and Development Skills class, I was required to make a resume even though I am not applying for a job. I was wondering, is it important to have a resume to apply for college in the future? #resume #college #preparing-for-college #resume-writing #career-development ","Hi Katie:  It is important to make a resume after High School to prepare for college and possible getting a job or interview for volunteer work or just to have all your skills and whatever jobs you have done listed somewhere so that when you do need to send your resume in you will have the facts written done and it will be easier. However, I will say this that making a resume after high school and before college is a little different than the one you will have after college.  What are the differences you ask: Here are some things that should be on the resume as a graduate from high school: 1. Your resume will be more about what classes  you took in high school and what your GPA was when graduating; 2. Also what were your extracurricular activities Sports, Newspaper editor, writer or photographer;  3. Any clubs that you belonged to and participated in events and maybe help an office like Secretary; Possibly in a sport, or had a job after school. These are all important to put on resume to enter a college.  After college you can put similar points of interest, but you must update it to your college activities when going on interviews after your college graduation. Here are some  points you should put on resumes after college: 1. Your skills and qualifications  that you will bring to the job you are interviewing for;  2. Any job that you worked at while in college even if it was volunteer or an internship and this is very important because they will have an even better perspective about you!! 3. You can put you GPA or any honors or achievement that you earned in college also; 4. If you were active in a club or sorority/fraternity and help an office that can be important also, along with any other club or activity that you were involved in. 5. If you excelled in a particular field of study and it applies to the job you are interviewing for the also put that under the education area or the honors and achievement area on your resume. I don't know if you have worked within the 20 years that you have prepared a resume, but it should be updated with all the new skills and qualifications that you have used and still want to use. 6. Even if you are not planning to work always keep you resume updated and in tact to make it easier to remember what you have done on jobs or volunteer work or more education, that way when you need a resume to give to someone you have it up dated! 7. This will come in handy for anything that is of interest to you so that the person knows more about what your skills are and what you like to do even if it has been a hobby. I hope these points have helped you define what is needed after high school and what else is needed after college. I also hope that these books that I named below have really helped me and hope they give you good information also!    , Yes.  Your education/career journey, like any other trip that you might plan, needs a clear cut destination with supporting information.  To make the most prudent use of your college time and money and make a favorable impression on a college and future employers,  it would benefit you greatly to have clear destination (career area) in mind and reinforce and strengthen that goal with such helpful items such as pertinent classes and extracurricular activities and hobbies and jobs.

0,Which countries have the highest demand for English teachers?,#English #iwanttobeabletogetajob,":) Maybe. It's not what you studied that matters, but what you learned.  I was a creative writing and interdisciplinary double major. An English degree is a great way to learn critical thinking and communications skills.  This comes through practice and spending significant time writing and researching. However, I do recommend double majoring in a more applied major (social sciences, engineering, math, etc). And an English degree in combination with many other degrees can go a long way.    Currently I do artificial intelligence research for a venture backed startup. Being an English major didn't automatically get me this job or any other jobs I had in the past. But it did set me apart. The communication skills were helpful when I interviewed. On the job I was able to communicate technical and complex ideas effectively to different audiences (managers, other technical colleagues, and non-technical audiences).  Structured thinking, clear articulation of ideas, and the ability communicate through writing are all useful skills that will be valuable in your career search."

Since you wish to learn English, then read books written in English and practice speaking English with friends and family members. No doubt, you've learned that it's a difficult language to read, write and speak because all the rules don't apply to the speaking and spelling of all the words. Regarding scholarships? We don't know what will occur regarding education in our universities. The tuition could rise even more because of our president-elect. So you might want to consider European universities initially. The hieroglyph might be easier to study.
Best luck,
Mark Wagner, Hi Shimaa! The best way to improve your English language skills is to engage with people who speak it better than you can.  Talk to the reference librarian at your local library to locate groups and organizations to which British and Americans or other English speakers are likely to belong and attend.  Look for groups and organizations that have an interest area that you share. it could be academic, social, recreational. or other.

It's never too early - or too late - to develop good study habits. The sooner you get into a good study groove, the easier everything will be and the more your chances of getting good marks will improve. Here are our top tips for getting the most out of study. Click each link for more about each tip. The explanation of each topic you can read on: http://www.youthcentral.vic.gov.au/studying-training/studying-tips-resources/top-10-study-tips Good luck and good studies!!, Often, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to things unrelated to the study material itself, such as time-management, boosting motivation and avoiding procrastination, and in improvements to sleep and diet. Time management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest benefit are given the greatest focus. A traffic lights system is a simple way of identifying the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours: Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple
Amber: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming
Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital. This reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit, while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows. The concept is similar to the ABC analysis, commonly used by workers to help prioritize. Also, some websites can be used for additional study materials and may help improve time management and increase motivation. In addition to time management, sleep is an important lifestyle change that could effect your studying. Sleeping less means that you have more time to study. This is a true fact, but just because you are “studying,” does not necessarily mean that your brain is processing everything that you are trying to learn or memorize. It is a proven fact that sleeping more can help you study better, because your brain can process more facts when it has had the rest it needs every night. In addition to time management and sleep, emotional state of mind matters when a student is studying, according to Benedict Carey in his book “The Surprising Truth About How We Learn and Why It Happens” when speaking about studying versus test taking “we perform better on tests when in the same state of mind as when we studied”  If an individual is calm or nervous in class; replicating that emotion can assist in studying. With replicating the emotion an individual is more likely to recall more information if they are in the same state of mind when in class.  This also goes the other direction; if one is upset but normally calm in class it’s much better to wait until they are feeling calmer to study. At the time of the test or class they will remember more., Hello Shailabai, Use Accelerated Learning Techniques to reach your full learning potential: http://vencergt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Accelerated-Learning-Techniques-Workbook.pdf Have a great career!, Hats Off to your question!

0,What college extracurriculars or organizations should I join that will help me get into medical school?,How do you pay for medical school?  Are there organizations that pay for your schooling under a certain agreement? #medical-school #scolarship ,Hey David. Medical school scholarships are available. Take a look at a scholarship website (search medical scholarships) and look at the qualifications needed to get the different scholarships. Start a plan  to meet those qualifications.
1,What college extracurriculars or organizations should I join that will help me get into medical school?,"I want to get a nice job as a business banker when I graduate from SLU, I currently am on a path for a dual Accounting/Economics major, and I want to know what will help me get the job I want  using my degree as a tool. Which clubs or organizations will help put some padding on my resume? Which clubs or organizations should I stay away from because they won't support my resume? #accounting #economics #SLU #banking #business #college ","Alexander, Good question. in addition to the other comments provided, I recommending going Beta Alpha Psi or another accounting group as most companies will recruit out of a program like that. If that is not available at your school, I would recommend going a group and becoming an active leader in that group so that you can demonstrate some leadership abilities. Lastly, I would focus on developing your technology and analytic skills (utilizing something as simple as excel). That will be important in any accounting career going forward.  , Hi Alexander!  Sounds like you're already on the right track with your double major choices!  What helped me when I was in college as an Accounting major and Economics minor, was joining a business fraternity within the business school of my university.  I was able to take a leadership position within that group which taught me valuable skills that were helpful to me once I graduated, and it provided me with examples of how I demonstrated those skills, which I was able to use on my resume and in job interviews.
I also attended the annual business school career fair, and was able to get a summer internship with a company in my desired field.  
Overall, I think any organization you join that will help you demonstrate the skills necessary for a career in business banking would be valuable to you.  These skills include such things as leadership, organization, critical thinking and analytical skills, teamwork, etc.

Good luck!, Hi Alexander!

I agree with everything said above! Another tip for finding a job is to network. I went to career fairs/club events and made it a point to introduce myself to the professionals in the room.  Just strike up a friendly conversation, and often times you can exchange contact information. Asking professionals to meet up for coffee or a 30 minute phone call lets you have 1 on 1 time with them to (1) answer career-related questions (2) potentially connect you with an available opportunity at their company. 

Professionals(especially recruiters) meet so many students, it is hard to stand out as a candidate. Establishing a 1 on 1 connection through a phone call or coffee meetup will help them keep you in mind when a position becomes available!



, Hello Alexander, Solid job on your double major so far! I think the best advice I could give is to get an internship. It demonstrates that you're motivated, hardworking, and looking to succeed and gain experience. I also recommend getting any leadership position in any club/organization that you're passionate about (if you're passionate about it, it will show). Just showing that you're trying to get involved in leadership positions in something that you love will definitely enhance your resume."

I'm aware of the many types that my school offers but I want to know how my time would be best spent as a pre-med student. I will of course do what I find enjoyable but I also want to know of any extracurriculars that strengthen my resume.   #pre-med #college-advice #extracurriculars #time-management ,"Hi, Erykah,  I cannot speak to extracurriculars that can bolster a resume in the medical field specifically, but I can give some general advice. I think it is important to continue activities that interest you. The key is finding a way to articulate how those activities make you an attractive candidate for a job. Your resume is not merely a sheet of paper that lists your academic achievements, skills, and prior work experience. It is a way to show an employer why you are the right person for a job. Be creative and figure out a way to make things that interest you also make you a stronger job candidate.   Engaging in some kind of community service is also a great idea. Many companies, hospitals included, encourage their employees to participate in philanthropic activities. Finding an organization whose mission you think is important and that you like to volunteer with is always a good idea and a great item to add to your resume.    I hope this helps - don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck!"
3,What college extracurriculars or organizations should I join that will help me get into medical school?,The college selection precess is very overwhelming.  Of course I want to get into a college that will help me get into a prestigious medical school. Are there any that you would recommend that I should research?   #doctor #medicine #science #college-major #pre-med #cardiology,"There does not appear to be only one path to becoming a doctor. It used to be only biology majors went to Med School, but now it seems they want more well-rounded candidates. Some people go to medical school after having a different first career. You will certainly need to take pre-requisites to qualify and to prepare for the MCATS. Find a school that seems to have a good placement rate for graduates pursuing an MD, has good science departments and seems like a good fit for you (geographically, student body size, campus life, etc.).  You will need  good grades in your college courses and that may be more important than where you go to school. Volunteering in a hospital is often recommended for students considering a medical career. Choosing a college can be overwhelming. WHERE you go may not be nearly as important as HOW well you do. You want to be happy at college so choose a school you like and then work hard. p.s.. I'm not a doctor, but I did study science and have friends who went to medical school. They were not science majors, went back when they were a little older and were still very successful. "
4,What college extracurriculars or organizations should I join that will help me get into medical school?,"What classes, extracurriculars, internships, jobs, etc. would you recommend an undergraduate student do to improve their chances of getting into medical school?

I'm going to be attending Washington University in St. Louis in the fall as an undergraduate student, so I have one of the best medical schools at my fingertips. Advice? #medicine #graduate-school #graduate #resume #medical-school #undergraduate #extracurriculars #activities",I think it's important to pick something you enjoy. Some examples of extracurricular activities are student government or joining a club or organization. Extracurricular activities show that you are well rounded and help create a balance in your life which you will need when you go to medical school. It's important to study hard and to take a break for fun!! Good luck with your pursuits!
